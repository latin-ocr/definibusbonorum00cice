BOOK IV. xiv

Good in the class of things entirely outside our con-
trol, as though they were discussing some creature
devoid of a inind; while others on the contrary
ignore ererything but mind, just as if man had 110
body3 and that though even the mind is not an
empty, impalpable something (a conception to
me unintelligible), bnt belongs to a certain kind of

- material substance, and therefore even the mind is

not satisfied with virtue alone, but desires freedom

from pain. In fact, with each school alike it is just as

good quality, yet at the same time they require to

have health and freedom from pain ; similarly there-

its chief glory in what is his chief excellence, namely

virtue. This being so, Ι feel you do not take suffi- ButwhenNature
