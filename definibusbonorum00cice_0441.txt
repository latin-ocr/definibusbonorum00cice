teacher Antiochus is very fond of employing. Car-

neades passed in review all the opinions as to the

Chief Good, not only that actually had been held by

philosophe-rs hitherto, but that it was possible to

hold. He then pointed out that no science or art

can supply its own starting-point ; its subj eet-matter

must always lie outside it. There is no need to

enlarge upon or illustrate >this point 3 for it is evident

that no art is occupied with itself: the art is dis-

tinct from the subject with which it deals; since

therefore, as medicine is the art of health and

navigation the art of sailing the ship, so Prudence

or Practical Wisdom is the art of conduct, it follows

-as to this there is no agreement. It is at this

point that all the difference of opinion among stu-

dents of the ethical problem arises. Of the whole

inquiry into the Ends of Goods and Ex'ils and the

question which among them is ultimate and final,

the fountain-head is to be found in the earliest

instincts of nature3 discover these and you have the

source of the stream, the starting-point of the debate

as to the Chief Good and Evil. ,
