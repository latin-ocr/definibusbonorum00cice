BOOK IV. vi

Preceding thinkers‚ and among them most explicitly
Polemo, had explained the Chief Good as being
‘to live in accordance with nature! This formula
receives from the Stoics three interpretations. The
first runs thus, ‘ to live in the light of a knowledge of
the natural sequence of causation.' This conception
of the End they declare to be identical with Zeno’s‚
being an explanation of your phrase ‘ to live in agree-
ment with nature.’ Their second interpretation is that interpreted as
it means the same as ε to live in the performance of ξζῖξῖἶξζίῗωε
all, or most, of one's intermediate duties.’ Β The nnuaccordance
Chief Good as thus exp3unded is not the same as ”mh nature.
that of the preceding interpretation. That is ‘right
action ' (as you rendered kaim-thoma), and can be
achieved only by the Wise Man, but this belongs to
duty merely inchoate, so to speak, and not perfect,
which may sometimes be attained by the foolish.
Again, the third interpretation of the formula is ς to
live in the enjoyment of all, or of the greatest, of those
things which are in accordance with nature.' This
does not depend solely on our own conduct, for it
involves two factors, first a mode of life enjoying
virtue, secondly a supply of the things which are in
accordance with nature but which are not within
our control. But the Chief Good as understood in
the third and last interpretation, and lise passed on
the basis of the Chief Good, being inseparably coupled
with virtue, lie within the reach of the VVise Man
alone3 and this is the account of the End of Goods,
as we read in the writings of the Stoics themselves,
which was given by Xenocrates and Aristotle. They
therefore describe the primary constitution of nature,
which was your starting point also, more or less in
the following terms.
