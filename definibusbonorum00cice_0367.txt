sometimes that the Stoics must be joking when they
say that, as between a life of virtue and a life of
virtue plus an oil-flask or a flesh—brush‚ the Wise
Man will prefer the lise with those additions, but yet

31 will not be any happier because of them. Pray does
this illustration really hold good? is it not rather to
be dismissed with a laugh than seriously refuted?
who would not riclily deserve to be laughed at if hc
troubled about having or not having an oil-flask? But
rid a man of bodily deformity or agonies of pain,
and you earn his deepest gratitude 2 even the Wise
Man, if a tyrant sent him to the rack, would

he would feel that he had a severe and searching
ordeal before him, and seeing that he was about to
encounter the supreme antagonist, pain, would sum-
mon up all his principles of courage and endurance
to fortify him against that severe and searching
struggle aforesaid.—Again, the question is not
whether such and such 3 good is 5ο trifling as to be
eclipsed or lost altogether, but whether it is of such

of pleasure of which we spoke, one pleasure is lost to
sight among the many3 but all the same, small as it is,

halfpenny is lost to sight amidst the riches of Croesus3
still it forms part of those riches. Hence the circum-
stances according to nature, as we call them, may be
unnoticed in 3 life of happiness, only you must allow
that they are parts of that happiness.
