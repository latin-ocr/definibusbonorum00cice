BOOK V. xxvii

oracular utterance‚ ⁶ Virtue need not look outside

herself for happiness’3 ‘Why?' says some one.

‘Because‚’ he answers, ‘nothing else is good but

what is morally good.’ Ι am not now asking whether

this is true ; I merely say that Zeno’s statements are
80 admirably logical and consistent. Suppose Epicurus

to say the same thing, that the Wise Man is always

happy,——-for he is fond of ranting like this now and

then, and indeed tells us that when the Wise Man is

suffering torments of pain, he will say ‘ How pleasant

this is ! how little Ι mind 1 '-Well‚ I should notjoin

issue with the man as to why lie goes so far astray

about the nature of the Good3 but I should insist

that he does not understand what is the necessary

corollary of his own avowal that pain is the supreme

evil. I take the same line now against you. As to

what is good and what is evil, your account agrees

entirely with that of those who have never set eyes

on a philosopher even in a picture, as the saying is ε

you call health‚ strength, poise, beauty, soundness

of every part from top to toe, goods, and ugliness‚
Sl disease and weakness evils. As for external goods,

you were, it is true, cautious3 but since these bodily

excellences are goods, you will doubtless reckon as

goods the things productive of them, namely friends,

children, relations, riches, rank and power. Mark

that against this I say nothing3 what Ι say is, if mis-

fortunes which a VVise Man may encounter are as you

say evils, to be wise is not enough for happiness.'' ‘⁶ Say Piso: Yes,

rather,'’ said he, “not enough for supreme happiness, {ssssuggssffltst
but it is enough for happiness.’' “ I noticed,'' Ι happiness.
replied, “ you made that distinction a little time cicero: How
ago, and Ι am aware that our master Antiochus is 2{fg¹r{{}¹gfbe
fond of saying the same; but what can be more un· happiness?
