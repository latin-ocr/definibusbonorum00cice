of them of positive and others of negative value,
and others neutral. Again among things valuable buttheyare dis-
—e.g. health, unimpaired senses, freedom from pain, {Psffflssffieglssn

them, such as pain, disease, loss of the senses, poverty‚

fond of saying that Latin is actually more copious than

Greek. However, to make it easier to understand

the meaning of this term it will not be out of place

to explain the method which Zeno pursued in coin-
