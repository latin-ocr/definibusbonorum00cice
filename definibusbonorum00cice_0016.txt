of the day. The exponents of each system, and the
minor interlocutors, are friends of Cicero's younger
days, all of whom were dead when he wrote3 brief
notes upon them will be found in the Index. The
rOle of critic Cicero takes himself throughout.

The first dialogue occupies Books Ι and II; in the
former the Ethics of Epicurus are expounded, and

in the latter refuted from the Stoic standpoint. The
scene is laid at Cicero’s villa in the neighbourhood
of Cumae, on the lovely coast a little north of
Naples. The spokesman of Epicureanism is L. Man-

(ΙΙ, 74) fixes the date of the conversation at 50 B.c.‚
shortly after Cicero’s return from his province of
Cilicia. A minor part is given to the youthful
C. Valerius Triarius.

In the second dialogue the Stoic ethics are ex-
pounded (in Book ΙΙΙ) by M. Cato, and criticized (in
Book IV) fron] the standpoint of Antiochus by
Cicero. Cicero has run down to his place at Tuscu-
lum, fifteen miles from town, for a brief September
holiday‚ while the Games are on at Rome3 and he
meets Cato at the neighbouring villa of Lucullus,
whose orphan son is Cato's ward. A law passed by
Pompey in 52 ns. is spoken of (IV, l) as new, so
the date falls in that year: Cicero went to Cilicia
in 51.

The third dialogue (Book V) goes back to a much
earlier period in Cicero's life. Its date is 79 and its
scene Athens, where Cicero and his friends are
eagerly attending lectures on philosophy. The posi-
tion of the “Old Academy’' of Antiochus is main-
tained by Μ. Pupius Piso Calpurnianus, and after-
wards criticized by Cicero from the Stoic point of
