design they found in the beauty of the ordered
world and in its adaptation to the use and comfort
of man. Apparent evil is but the necessary imperfec-

tion of the parts as pa1·ts; the whole is perfectly good.
As this world had a beginning, so it will have an

end in time; it is moving on towards a universal
conflagration, in which all things will return to the
prima] F ire from which they sprang. But only for
a moment will unity be restored. The causes that
operated before must operate again3 once more the
creative process will begin, and all things will recur
exactly as they have occurred already. So existence
goes on, repeating itself in an unending series of
identical cycles.

Such rigorous determinism would seem to leave no
room for human freedom or for moral choice. Yet the
Stoics maintained that though man’s acts like all
other events are fore-ordained, his will is free. Obey the
divine ordinance in any case he must, but it rests with
him to do so willingly or with reluctance. To under-
stand the world in which he finds himself, and to sub-
mit his will thereto—herein man's well-being lies.

On this foundation they real-ed an elaborate struc-
ture of Ethics. Their formula for conduct was ‘To
live in accordance with nature.’ To interpret this,
they appealed, like Epicurus, to instinct, but with a
different result. According to the Stoics, not plea-
sure but self—preservation and things conducive to it
are the objects at which infants and animals aim.
Such objects are ‘ primary in the order of nature’3
and these objects and others springing out of them,
viz.‚ all that pertains to the safety and the full deve·
lopment of man's nature, constitute the proper aim
