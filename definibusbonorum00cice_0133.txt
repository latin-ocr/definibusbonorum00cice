ject under investigation. Had Epicurus cleared up
the meaning of pleasure, he would not have fallen
into such confusion. Either he would have upheld
pleasure in the same sense as Aristippus, that is, an
agreeable and delightf ul excitation of the sense, which
is what even dumb cattle, if they could speak, would
call pleasure; or, if he preferred to use an idiom of
his own, instead of speaking the language of the

he might have confined the name of pleasure to this
state of freedom from pain, and despised pleasure as
Aristippus understands it; or else, if he approved of
both sorts of pleasure, as in fact he does, then he
ought to combine together pleasure and absence of

tinguished philosophers have as a matter of fact thus
interpreted the ultimate Good as composite. For
instance, Aristotle combined the exercise of virtue
with well-being lasting throughout a complete life-
time3 Callipho united pleasure with moral worth;
Diodorus to moral worth added freedom from pain.
Epicurus would have followed their example, had he
coupled the view we are discussing, which as it is
belongs to Hieronymus, with the old doctrine of
Aristippus. For there is a real difference of opinion
between them, and accordingly each sets up his own
separate End3 and as both speak unimpeachable
Greek, Aristippus, who calls pleasure the Chief
Good, does not count absence of pain as pleasure‚
while Hieronymus, who makes the Chief Good
