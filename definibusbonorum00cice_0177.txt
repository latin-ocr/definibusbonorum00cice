BOOK ΙΙ. xvii-xviii

troubled by remorse ? Not a bit of it. On the con-
trary, the inheritance made him a rich man, and 116
was thoroughly pleased with himself in consequence.
He thought 116 had scored heavily: 116 had won a
fortune, not only by no illegal means, but actually
by the aid of the law. And according to your school
it is right to try to get money even at some risk;
for money procures many very delightful pleasures.

“Thereforejust as those who hold that things right
and honourable are desirable for their own sake must
osten take risks in the cause of honour and niomlity,
so Epicureans, who measure all things by pleasure,
may properly take risks in order to obtain consider-
able pleasures. If a large sum of money or a great
inheritance is at stake, inasmuch as money procures
a great many pleasures, your Epicurus, if he wishes
to attain his own Eud of Goods, will have to act
as Scipio did, when he had the chance of winning
great renown by enticing Hannibal back to Africa.
To do so, he risked enormous dangers. For honour
and not pleasure was the aim of that great enter-
prise. Similarly‚ your Epicurean Wise Man, when
stirred by the prospect of some considerable gain,
will fight to the death, if need be, and with good
reason. Do circumstances allow his crime to go
undetected, so much the better-3 but if found out,
he will make light of every penalty. For he will
have been sehooled to make light of death, of exile,
even of pain itself. The latter indeed you make
out to be unendurable when you are enacting
penalties for the wicked, but easy to bear when
you are maintaining that the &Vise Man will always
command a preponderance of Good.
