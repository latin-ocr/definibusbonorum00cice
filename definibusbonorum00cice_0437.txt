book On Happiness, in which a very considerable
amount ofimportance is assigned to fortune ; though
if this be correct, wisdom alone could not guar-

if I may so call it, too enervating and unmanly to be
adequate to the force and dignity of virtue. Hence
we had better keep to Aristotle and his son Nico-
machus; the latter’s elaborate volumes on Ethics
are ascribed, it is true, to Aristotle,but 1 (10 not see

superior to1the philosophers of any other school, but
are so unworthy of their ancestry that one might
imagine them to have been their own teachers. To
begin with,Theophrastus’s pupil Strato set up to be
a natural philosopher: but great as he is in this de-

novator3 and 011 ethics he has hardly anything. His
successor Lyco has a copious style, but his matter is
somewhat barren. Lyco’s pupil Aristo is polished
and graceful, but has not the authority that we
expect to find in a great thinker3 he wrote much,
it is true, and he wrote well, but his style is some·
how lacking in weight.

“I pass over a number of writers, including the
learned and entertaining Hieronymus. Indeed Ι
know no reason for calling the latter a Peripatetic
at all; for he defined the Chief Good as freedom
from pain: and to hold a different view of the
Chief Good is to hold a different system of philo-
