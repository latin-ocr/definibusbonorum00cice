for any practical advantage3 and they argue that
just as we desire the welfare of our children, even
of such as may be born after we are dead, for their
own sake, so a man ought to study his reputation
even after death, for itself, even apart from any
advantage.

‘⁶ But although we pronounce Moral worth to be Anfappropriaze
the sole good, it is nevertheless consistent to perform ffissgssc'tffigfflffl*
an appropriate act, in spite of the fact that we count among in· ,
appropriate action neither a good nor an evil. For in ῗῆἓξὲῗᾷῑ ξξὲῐὲῗῗῑ
the sphere of these neutral things there is an element ξξξξῐξέῑξως as

be rendered of it, and therefore in the sense that an {agzzrsslstbecomffl
account can also be rendered of an act reasonably ³0²³0¹²³
performed ; now an appropriate act is an act so per-
formed that a reasonable account can be rendered
of its performance3 and this proves that an appro-
priate actis an intermediate thing, to be reckoned
neither as a good nor as the opposite. And since
those things which are neither to be counted among
virtues nor vices nevertheless contain a factor which
can be useful, their element of utility is worth pre-
serving. Again, this neutral class also includes action
of a certain kind, viz. such that reason calls upon us
to do or to produce some one of these neutral things 3
but an action reasonably performed we call an appro-
priate act3 appropriate action therefore is included
in the class which is reckoned neither as good nor
the opposite

performed by the VVise Man in the sphere of these
neutral things. Well then, when he does such an
action he judges it to be an appropriate act. And
as his judgment on this point never errs, therefore
