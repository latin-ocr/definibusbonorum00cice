Yon Stoics say that all transgressions are equal. 1
won’t jest with you iiow, as Ι did on the same sub-
jects when you were prosecuting and Ι defending
Lucius Murena.a On that occasion I was addressing
a jury, not an audience of scholars, and I even had
to play to the gallery a little3 but now Ι must reason

⁵ more closely. Transgressions are equal.—How 50,

pray?—Because nothing can be better than good or
baser than base.—Explain further, for there is much
disagreement on this point; let us have your special
arguments to prove how all transgressions are equal,
—Suppose, says my opponent, osa number of lyres
not one is so strung as to be in tune3 then all are
equally out of tune3 similarly with transgressions,
since all are departures from rule, all are equally
departures from rule; therefore all are equal.—-
Here we are put off with an equivocation. All the
lyres equally are out of tune; but it does not follow
that all are equally out of tune. So your coin-
parison does not help you; for it does not follow
that because we pronounce every case of avarice
equally to be avarice‚ we must therefore pronounce
them all to be equal. Here is another of these
false analogies: A skipper, says my adversary, com-
mits an equal transgression if he loses his ship with
a cargo of straw and if he does so when laden with
gold3 similarly 3 111311 is an equal transgressor if he
beats his parent or his slave without due cause.—
Fancy not seeing that the nature of the cargo has
nothing to do with the skill of the navigator! so
that whether he carries gold or straw makes no dif-
ference as regards good or bad seamanship3 whereas
the distinction between a parent and a mere slave
