his hand in that condition wanted nothing, was not
justified in his second admission, that if pleasure were
a good, his hand would have wanted it. And the
reason why it would not have wanted pleasure is,
that to be without pain is to be in a state of plcasure.

XII. “The truth of the position that pleasure is the
ultimate good will most readily appear srom the
following illustration. Let us imagine 3 inan living
in the continuous enjoynient of numerous and vivid
pleasures alikc of body and of mind, undisturbcd
either by the presence or by the prospect of pain:
what possible state of existence could we describe as
being more excellent or 111010 desirablc? One so
situated must possess 111 1110 first place a strength of
mind that is proof against all sear of death or of
pain3 he will know that death means complete un-
consciousness, and that pain is generally light if long
and short if strong, so that its intensity is compen-
sated by brief duration and its continuance by
diminishing severity. Let such a man nim-cover
have no dread of any supernatural powcr; let him
never suffer the pleasures of the past to fade away,
but constantly renew their enjoyment in recollec-
tion,-—and his lot will be one which will not admit
of further improvement. Suppose on tlic 011101 hand
a person crushcd beneath the lieaviest load of mental
and of bodily anguish to which humanity is liable.
Grant him no hope of ultimate relief in view ;
also give him no pleasure either present or in
prospect. Can one describe or imagine a more piti-
able state? lf then a life full of pain is the thing
most to be avoided, it follows that to live in pain is
the highest evil ; and this position implies that 3 life

of pleasure is the ultimate good. In fact 111041111ῃά
