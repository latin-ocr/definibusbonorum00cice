with the former doctrine they are lauded in the
position of Arist03 and when they try to escape from
this they adopt what is in reality the position of the
Peripatetics, though still clinging tooth and nail to
their own terminology. Unwilling again to take
the next step and weed out this terminology, they

full of asperitics of style and even of manners.

79 Panaetius strove to avoid this uncouth and repellant
development of Stoicism, censui-ing alike the harsh-
ness of its doctrines and the crabbedness of its
logie. ln doctrine he was mellower‚ and in style
more lucid. Plato, Aristotle, Xenocrates, Theo-
phrastus and Dicearchus were constantly 011 his lips,
as his writings show; and these authors Ι strongly
advise you to take up for your most careful study.

80 But evening is closing in, and I must be getting

will,’' he replied3 “for how could we be better
employed? and the first favour Ι shall ask of you is
to listen to my refutation of what you have said.
But bear in memory that whereas you really accept
all of our opinions save for the difference of termin-
ology, I on the contrary do not accept any of the
tenets of your school.’' “ A parting shot indeed !’'
said I ; “ but we shall see.'' And with these words
I took my leave.
