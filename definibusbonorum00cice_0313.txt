of the Foolish Man to remain in lise although he is

61 miserable. For with the Stoics good and evil, as
has repeatedly been said already, are a subsequent
outgrowth3 whereas the primary things of nature,
whether favourable or the reverse,a fall under the
judgment and choice of the Wise Man, and form
so to speak the subject-matter, the given material
with which wisdom deals. Therefore the reasons
both for remaining in life and for departing from it
are to be measured entirely by the primm-y things
of nature aforesaid. For the virtuous man is not
necessarily retained in life by virtue, and also those
who are devoid of virtue need not necessarily seek
death. And very often it is appropriate for the &Vise
Man to abandon life at a moment when he is enjoy-
ing supreme happiness, if an opportunity offers for
making a timely exit. For the Stoie view is that
happiness, which means life in harmony with nature,
is a matter of seizing the right moment. So that
VVisdom her very self upon occasion bids the Wise
Man to leave her. Hence, as vice does not possess
the power of furnishing a reason for suicide, it is clcar
that even for the foolish, who are also miserable, it
is appropriate to remain alive if they possess a pre-
dominance of those things which we pronounce to
be in accordance with nature. And since the fool is
equally miserable when departing from life and
when remaining in it, and the undesirability of his
life is not increased by its prolongation, there is
good ground for saying that those who are in a
position to enjoy a preponderance of things that are
natural ought to remain in life.
