BOOK 111. ii

out of town, and arrived late in the afternoon. My
reason for coming on here was to get some books
from the library. By the way, Cato, it will soon be
time for our friend Lucullus to make acquaintance
with this fine collection; sor I hope he will take
more pleasure in his library than in all the other
appointinents of his country-house. I am extremely
anxious (though of course the responsibility belongs
especially to you) that he should have the kind of
education that will turn him out after the same
pattern as his father and our dear Caepio, and also
yourself, to whom he is so closely related. And I
have every motive for my interest in him. I cherish
the memory of 1113 grandfather³ (and you are aware
how highlyl esteemed Caepio, who in my belief would
to-day be in the front rank, were he still alive). And
also Lucullus is always present to my mind3 he was
a man of general 611111161166, and united to me in

“I commend you‚'’ rejoined Cato, “for your loyalty
to the nieniory of men who both beqncathed their
children to your care, as well as sor your affectionate
interest in the lad. My own responsibility, as you
call it, I by no means disown, but I enlist you to
share it with me. Moreoverl may say that the
youth already seems to 1116 to show many signs both
of modesty and talent; but you know how young he
is.'’ “ Ι do,’' said 1, “ but all the same it is time for
him to receive a tincture of studies which, if allowed
to soal< in at this impressionable age, will render him
better equipped when he comes to the business of
life.’' “ True, and we will discuss this matter again
several times more fullyand take common action. But
let ussit down,’' he said, “shall we ? '' So we sat down.
