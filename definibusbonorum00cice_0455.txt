nevertheless, so that no step may be omitted, I sup-
pose Ι ought also to give reasons to show why it is
so, Yet how can you form any intelligible concep—
tion of an animal that should hate itself? The thing
is a contradiction in terms. For the creature being
its own enemy, the instinctive appetition we spoke
of will deliberately set about drawing to itsels some-
thing harmful to itself; yet it will be doing this
for its own sake ; therefore the animal will both

will avoid things that are desirable and seek things
that ought to be avoided ; but this undeniably would
mean to turn the whole of life upside down. Α few
people may be found who attempt to end their lires
with a halter or by other means; but these, or the
character of Terenee³ who (in his own words) ‘ re-
solved that if he made himself to suffer, he so made
less the wrong he did his son‚’ are not to be put down
as haters of themselves. The motive with some is
grief, with others passion3 many are rendered insane
by anger, and plunge into ruin with their eyes open,
fancying all the time that what they do is for their
own best interests. Hence they say, and say in all

dent: such lamentations show that they love and
care for themselves. It follows that whenever
