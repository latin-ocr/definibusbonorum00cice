anything beside Moral Worth be counted in it, will
also be maintained by the philosophers whom Ι just
now mentioned. To my mind it would have been
fairer for Zeno in his dispute with Polemo, whose
teaching as to the primary impulses of nature he
had adopted, to have started from the fundamental
tenets which they held in common, and to have
marked the point where hc first called a halt and
where occasion for divergence arose; not to take his
stand with thinkers who did not even profess to hold
that the Chief Good, as they severally conceived
it, was based 011 natural instinct, and employ the
same arguments and the same doctrines as thcy did.

XVII. “Another point to which I take great
exception is that, when you have proved, as you
think, that Moral worth alone is good, you then
turn round and say that of course there must be
advantages adapted to our nature set before 115 as a
starting point, in exercising choice among which
advantages virtue may be able to come into exis-
tence. Now it was a mistake to make virtue consist
in an act of choice, for this implies that the very
thing that is the ultimate Good itself seeks to get
something else. Surely the sum of Goods must
include everything worth adopting, choosing 01·
desiring, so that he who has attained it may not
want anything more. In the case of those whose
Chief Good consists in pleasure, notice how clear it is
what things they are to do or not to do; no one can
be in doubt as to the proper scope of all their duties,
what these must aim at and what avoid. Or grant
the ultimate Good that Ι am now upliolding, and it
becomes clear at once what one's duties are and
what actions are prescribed. But you, who have no
