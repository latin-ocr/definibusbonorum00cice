crooked; similarly the nature of wild animals, though

not indeed corrupted by bad education, is corrupt of

its own nature. Again in the infant the natural in-

stinct is not to seek pleasure; its instinct is merely

towards sels-regard, sels-preservation and protection

from injury. Every living creature, from the moment

of birth, loves itself and all its members3 primarily

this self-regard embraces the two main divisions of
