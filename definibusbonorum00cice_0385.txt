principle which must cover both the springs of action
and the ultimate Goods3 and that just as Aristo’s
doctrine had been quite discredited, that there
is no diflerence between one thing and another,
and nothing whatever to choose between any other
things but virtues and vices, so Zeno was inistaken in
saying that (a) nothing else but virtue or vice allec-ted

Chief Good, and (b) although other things had no
effect whatever upon happineSS‚ yet they had some
influence upon our desires; just as though desire,

more inconsistent than the procedure they profess,
to ascertain the Chief Good first, and then to return
to Nature, and demand from her the primary motive
of conduct or of duty? Considerations of conduct
or duty do not supply the impulse to desire the
things that are in accordance with nature3 it is
these things which excite desire and give motives
for conduct.
