BOOK III. xiii

that considers pain no evil clearly proves that the Wise
Man retains his happiness amidst the worst torments.
The mere fact that men endure the same pain more
easily when they voluntarily undergo it for the sake of
their country than when they suffer it for some lesser
cause, shows that the intensity of the pain depends on
the state of mind of the suffer-er, not on its own intrin-
sic nature. Further, on the Peripatetic theory that „numnapplnesn
there are three kinds of goods, the inore abundantly ἓῗέζζῖς ofde-
supplied a man is with bodily or external goods‚ the
happier he is ; but it does not follow that we Stoics can
accept the same position, and say that the more a man
has of those bodily things that are highly valued the
happier he is. For the Peripatetics hold that the sum of
happiness includes bodily advantages, but we deny
this altogether. XVe hold that the multiplication even
of those goods thatin our view are truly so called does
not render life happier or inore desirable or of higher
value; even less therefore is happiness affected by
the accuniulation of bodily advantages. Clearly if
wisdom and health be both dcsstable, a combination
of the two would be more desirable than wisdom
alone3 but it is not the case that if both be deserv-
ing of value, wisdom plus wealth is worth inore than
wisdom by itself separately. We deern health to be
deserving of a certain value, but we do not reckon
it a good3 at the same time we rate no value so
highly as to place it above virtue. This is not the
view of the Peripatetics, who are bound to say that
an action which is both morally good and not attended
by pain is more desirable than the same action if
accompanied by pain. We think otherwise—whether
rightly 01· wrongly, Ι will consider later ; but how could
there be a wider or more real difference of opinion?
