BOOK IV. xxiv-xxv

the case of arts or sciences which admit of advance-
ment, the opposite of those arts and sciences will also
admit of advance3 but virtue is absolute and incap-
able of increase; therefore the vices also, being the
opposite of the virtues, are incapable of gradation.
Pray tell me then, does a certainty explain 311 un-
certainty, or does 311 uncertainty disprove a cer-
tainty? Now, that some vices are worse than others
is certain3 but whether the Chief Good, as you Stoics
conceive it, can be subject to increase is not certain.
Yet instead of employing the certain to throw light
on the uncertain, you endeavour to make the uncer-

68 tain disprove the certain. Therefore you can be
checkmated by the same argument as Ι employed
just noxv. If the proof that one vice cannot be
worse than another depends on the fact that the End
of Goods, as you conceive it, is itself incapable of
increase, then you must alter your End of Goods,
since it is certain that the vices of all men are not
equal. For we are bound to hold that if a conclusion
is false, the premise on which it depends cannot be
true.
