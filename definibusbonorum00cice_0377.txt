virtue go to make up happiness, virtue cannot be virtue is under-
established. As a matter of fact it is entirely the ffizne‘lfflssfgssac,
other way about: it is impossible to find a place for {ordipgtotxa-
virtue, unless all the things that shc chooses and bffifetcfi'ssgffi-
rejects are reckoned towards one sum-total of good. {¹{{{35ft}‘j{¹gss¹.¹e

For if we entirely ignore ourselves,a we shall fall into lectingthese,aryf1
the mistakes and errors of Aristo, forgetting the ζοξξῖἒῐὲῑηὲὃηᾷἶζ
things that we assigned as the origins of virtue nature.
herself3 if while not ignoring these things, we yet

do not reckon them in the End or Chief Good, we

shall be well on the road towards the extravagances

of Erillus, since we shall have to adopt two different

rules of life at once. Erillus sets up two separate
ultimate Goods, which, supposing his view were

true, he ought to have united in one; but as it is he
makes them so separate as to be mutually exclusive
alternatives, which is surely the extreme of perversity.
Hence the truth is just the opposite of what you

say; virtue is an absolute impossibility, unless it
holds to the objects of the priinary instincts as
going to make up the suin of good. For we started

to look for avirtue that should protect, not abandon,
nature; whereas virtue as you conceive it protects a
particular part of our nature but leaves the remainder

in the lurch. Man’s constitution itself, if it could
speak, would declare that its earliest tentative
movements of desire were aimed at preserving
itself 111 the natural character with which it was
born into the world. But at that stage the principa]
intention of nature had not yet been fully revealed.
well, suppose it revealed. What then? will it be
construed otherwise than as forbidding that any

part of man’s nature should be ignored? If man
consists solely of a reasoning faculty, let it be granted
