they live a life of untroubled bliss in the empty spaces
between the worlds. The human soul like every-
thing else is materia13 it consists of atoms of the
smallest and most mobile sort, enclosed by the

coarser atoms of the body, and dissipated when the
body is dissolved by death. Death therefore means

extinction.

Thus man was relieved from the superstitious that
preyed upon his happiness,—fear of the gods and
sear of punishment after death. But a worse tyranny
remained if all that happens is caused by inexorable
fate. Here comes in the doctrine of the Swerve‚
which Cicero derides, but which is essentia] to the
system. Democritus had taught that the heavier
atoms fell faster through the void than the lighter
ones, and so overtook them. Aristotle corrected the
err0r3 and Epicurus turned the correction to account.
He gave his atoms a uniform vertical velocsty, but
supposed them to collide by casually making a slight
sideway movement. This was the minimum hypo-
thesis that he could think of to account for the
formation of things; and it served his purpose by
destroying the conception of a fixed order in Nature.
The capacity to swerve is shared by the atoms that
compose the human soul; hence it accounts for the
action of the will, which Epicurus regards as entirely
undetermined. In this fortuitous universe man is
free to make his own happiness.

In Ethics Epicurus based himself on Aristippus,
the pupil of Socrates and founder of the School of
