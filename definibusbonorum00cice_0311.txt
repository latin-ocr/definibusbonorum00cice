appropriate action will exist in the sphere of these
neutral things. The same thing is also proved by
the following argument : We observe that something
exists which we call right action ; but this is an
appropriate act perfectly performed; therefore there
will also be such a thing as an imperfect appropriate
act ; so that, if to restore a trust as a matter of prin-
ciple is a right act, to restore a trust must be counted
as an appropriate act ; the addition of the qualifica-

to be chosen and others to be rejected3 therefore
whatever is done or described in this manner is cn-
tirely included under the term appropriate action.
This shows that since love of self is implanted by
nature in all men, both the foolish and the wise alike
will choose what is in accordance with nature and re-
ject the contrary. Thus there is a region ofappropriate
action which is common to the wise and the unwise ;
and this proves that appropriate action deals with
the things we call nenti-al. But since these neutral amanen!

in prospect a majority of the contrary things, it is
appropriate for him to depart srorn life. This makes
it plain that it is on occasion appropriate for the
Wise Man to quit life although he is happy, and also
