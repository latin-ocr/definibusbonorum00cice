nature at all events at the outset is curiously hidden
from us, and we cannot fully realize or understand
it; yet as we grow older we gradually or Ι should
say tardily coine, as it were, to know ourselveS.
Accordingly, the earliest feeling of attraction which
nature has created in us towards ourselves is vague
and obscure, and the earliest instinct of appetition
only strives to secure our safety and freedom from
injury. When, however, we begin to look about us
and to perceive what we are and how we differ from
the rest of living creatur-es, we then coxnmence to
pursue the objects for which we are intended by

s nature. Some resemblance to this process we ob-

serve in the lower animals. At first they do not
move from the place where they were born. Then
they begin to move, under the influence of their
several instincts of appetition3 we see little snakes
gliding, ducklings swimming, blackbirds dying, oxen
using their horns, scorpions their stings; each in fact
has its own nature as its guide to life. A similar
process is clearly seen in the human race. Infants
just born lie helpless, as if absolutely inanimate3
when they have acquired a little more strength, they
exercise their mind and their senses; they strive
to stand erect, they use their hands, they recognize
their nurses ; then they take pleasure in the society
of other children, and enjoy meeting them, they
take part in games and love to hear stories; they
desire to bestow of their own abundance in bounty

goes on in their homesg they begin to reflect and
to learn, and want to know the names of the people
they see3 in their contests with their companions they
are elated by victory, discouraged and disheartened
