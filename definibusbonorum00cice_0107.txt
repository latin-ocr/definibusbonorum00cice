BOOK Ι. xxi

whole discourse relies throughout for confirmation
on the unbiased and unimpcachable evidence of the
senses; if lisping infants, nay even dunib animals,
proinpted by Nature's tcaching, almost find voice to
proclaim that there is no welfare but pleasure, no
hardship but pain—and their judgment in these
matters is neither sophisticated nor biased—ought
we not to feel the greatest gratitude to him who
caught this utterance of Nature's voice, and
grasped its import so firmly and so fully that he has
guided all sane-minded men into the paths of peace
and happiness, calmness and repose? You are
pleased to think him uneducated. The reason is
that he refused to consider any education worth the
name that did not help to school us in happiness.
Was he to spend his time, as you encourage Triarius
and me to do, in perusing poem, who give us nothing
solid and useful, but merely childish amusement?
&Vas he to occupy himself like Plato with music and
geometry, arithmetic and astronomy, which starting
from false premises cannot be true, and which more-
over if they were true would contribute nothing to
make our lives pleasanter and therefore better?
VVas he, I say, to study arts like these, and neglect
the master art, so difficult and correspondingly so
fruitful, the art of living? No! Epicurus was not
uneducated: the real philistines are those who ask
us to go on studying till old age the subjects that
we ought to be ashamed not to have learnt in
boyhood.'' Thus concluding, he added: “I have
explained my own view, but solely with the object
of learning what your verdict is. I have never
hitherto had a satisfactory opportunity of hearing
it„”
