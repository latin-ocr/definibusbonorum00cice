BOOK III. ix-x

latter are sins not in their subsequent effects‚ but
immediately upon their inception; similarly, actions
springing from virtue are to be judged right from
their first inception, and not in their successful
completion.

employed so frequently in this discourse2 is also ex· {ffl'lseom'e
plained by definition. The Stoic definitions do in-
deed differ from one another in a very minute degree,
but they all point in the same direction. Personally
I agree with Diogenes in defining the Good as that
which is by nature perfect. He wasled by this also
to pronounce the ‘ beneficia] ' (for so let us render the
Greek ὀρΙῑεΙὲηια) to be a motion 01· state in accordance
with that which is by nature perfect. Now notions
of things are produced in the mind when something
has become known either by experience or combina-
tion of ideas or analogy or logical inferencc. 'l'he
fourth and last method in this list is the one that has
givenustheconceptionostheGood. The mind ascends
by inference froin the things in accordance with
nature till finally it arrives at the notion of Good.

34 At the same time Goodness is absolute, and is not a
question of degree 3 the Good is recognized and pro-
nounced to be good from its own inherent properties
and not by comparison with other things. Just as
lioney, though extremely sweet, is yet perceived to
be sweet by its own peculiar kind of flavour and not
by being compared with something else, so this
Good which we are discussing is indeed superlatively
valuable, yet its value depends on kind and not 011
quantity. Value, in Greek amici, is not counted as a
Good nor yet as an Evil 3 so that however much you
increase it in amount, it will still remain the same
