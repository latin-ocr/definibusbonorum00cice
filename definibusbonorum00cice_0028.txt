that Arcesilas and Carneades, though attacking the
Criterion of the Stoics, had not meant to deny all
possibility of knowledge. The Stoic ‘comprehen-
sion ’ was impossible, but yet there was a ⁸ clearness'
about some impressions that gives a conviction 01

oblivion. Aristotle's cardinal doctrines are, that
well-being consists not in the state of virtue but in
the active exercise of all human excellences, and
particularly of man's highest gift of rational con-
