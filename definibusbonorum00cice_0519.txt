The conclusions agree with the first principles, the
middle steps with both, in fact every part with every
other. They understand what inference follows from
and what contradicts a given premise. It is like
geometry: grant the premises and you must grant
everything. Admit that there is no good but Moral
Worth, and you are bound to admit that happiness
consists in virtue. Or again conversely: given the
latter, you must grant the former. Your school are
not so logical. ‘Three classes of goods’: your ex-
position runs smoothly on. But when it comes to its
conclusion, it finds itself in trouble; for it wants
to assert that the Wise Man can lack no requisite
of happiness. That is the moral style, the style
of Socrates, and of Plato too. ‘I dare assert it,’
eries the Academic. You cannot, unless you recast
the earlier part of the argument. If poverty is an
evil, no beggar can be happy, be he as wise as you
like. But Zeno dared to say that a wise beggar was
not only happy but also wealthy. Pain is an evil :
then a man undergoing crucifixion cannot be happy.
Children are a good: then childlessness is mise·
rable3 one’s country is a good z then exile is mise-
rable3 health is a good : then sickness is miserable 3
soundness of body is a good : then infirmity is
miserable3 good eyesight is a good z then blindness
is miserable. Perhaps the philosopher’s consolations
can alleviate each of these missortunes singly 3 but
how will he enable us to endure them all to-
gether? Suppose a man to be at once blind, infirm,

afflicted by dire disease, in exile, childless, destitute
and tortured on the rack3 what is your name, Zeno„
for him? ‘A happy mans says Zeno. A supremely

happy man as well? ‘To be sure} he will reply,
