BOOK IV. v-vi

governed by a divine mind and substance. In point
of sullness, however, and fertility of treatment we
shall find the Stoics meagre, whereas the Peripatetics
are copious in the extreme. What stores of facts
they observed and recorded about the classification,
reproduction, morphology and life-history of animals
of every kind ἔ and again about plants! How
copious and wide in range their explanations of the
causes and demonstrations of the mode of different
natural phenomena 1 and all these stores supply them
with numerous and conclusive arguments to ex-
plain the nature of each particular thing. So far
then, as far as I at least can understand the case,
there appears to have been no reason for the change
of name³; that Zeno was not prepared to follow the
Peripatetics in every detail did not alter the fact
that he had sprung from them. For my own part I
consider Epicurus also, at all events in natural
philosophy, simply a pupil of Democritus. He makes
a few modifications, or indeed a good many; but on
most points, and unquestionably the most important,
he merely echoes his master. Your leaders do the
same, yet neglect to acknowledge their full debt to
the original discoverers.

VI. “But leaving this let us now, if you ple-ase,
turn to Ethics. On the subject of the Chief Good,

which is the keystone of philosophy, what precise
contribution did Zeno make tojustify his disagreeing

with his ancestors, the originators of the doctrine ?
Under this head you, Cato, gave a careful exposition
of the Stoics' conception of this ‘ End of Goods,’ and
of the meaning they attached to the term 3 still I also
will restate it, to enable us to detect, if we can, what
exactly was the novel element contributed by Zeno.
