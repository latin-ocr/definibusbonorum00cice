BOOK III. xxii

,ieet to no man’s authority, and slave of no appetite ·,
rightly unconquerable‚ for though his body be tin-own

76 into fetters, no bondage can enchain his soul. Nor
need he wait for any period of time, that the decision
whether he has been happy or not may be finally
pronounced only when l1e has rounded off his life’s
last day in death,—the famous warning so unu-isely
given to Croesus by old Solon, one of the seven
&Vise Men; for had Croesus ever been happy, he would
have carried his happiness uninterrupted to the pyre
raised for him by Cyrus. If then it be true that all
the good and none but the good are happy, what
possession is more previous than philosophy, what
more divine than vi1·tue?''
