happiness of the Wise Man to attain its final and
ultimate perfectiori, if all his wise designs and good
deeds were to be successively erased from his
106 memory. But with you it is the recollection of
pleasures enjoyed that gives happiness; and those
must be bodily pleasures,—for if it be any others, it
ceases to be true that mental pleasures all arise
from the connection of the mind with the body.
Yet if bodily pleasure even when past can give
delight, I do not see why Aristotle²¹ should be so
contemptuous of the epitaph of sardanapalus. The
famous Syrian monarch boasts that he has taken
with him all the sensual pleasures that he has
enjoyed. How, asks Aristotle, could a dead man
continue to experience a feeling which even while
alive he could only be conscious of so long as he was
actually enjoying it? So that bodily pleasures are
transient3 each in turn evaporates, leaving cause for
regrets more often than for recollection. Accordingly
Africanus must be counted happier than Sardanapa-
lus, when he addresses his country with the words:

Cease, Rome, thy foes—-

and the glorious conclusion:

My toils have won thee battlements secure.b

His past toils are what he delights in, whereas you
bid us dwell upon our past pleasures3 he recalls ex-
periences that never had any connection with bodily
enjoyment‚ but you never rise above the body.
