BOOK ΙΙ. xix

Decius, the first of his family to be consul? When
Decius vowed himself to death, and setting spurs to
his horse was charging into the thickest of the Latin
ranks, surely he had no thought of persona] pleasure?
Pleasure where to be enjoyed or when? For he
knew he must die in a moment, aye and he courted
death with more passionate ardour than Epicurus
would have us seek pleasure. Had not his exploit
won praise on its mei-its, it would not have been
copied by his sou in his fourth consulship3 nor
would the latter-'s son again, commanding as consul in
the war with Pyrrhus, have also fallen in battle, third
in succession of his line to give himself a victim for

62 the state. Irefrain fromfurtherinstances. The Greeks

have but a modest list,—Leonidas, Epaminondas,
some three or four3 but were Ι to begin to cite the
heroes of our race, I should doubtless succced in
making Pleasure yield herself prisoner to Virtue, but
——daylight would fail before I had done. Aulus
Varius, noted for his severity as a judge, used to say
to his colleague on the bench, when after witnesses
had been produced still further witnesses were
called: ‘Either we have evidence enough already,
or Ι (10 not know what evidence can be enough.’
Well, I have cited witnesses enough. Why, you
yourself, in every way a worthy scion of your stock,
——was pleasure the inducement that led you, a mere
youth, to wrest the consulship from Publius Sulla ?
You won that office for your gallant father; and what
a consul he was! What a patriot, all his life long
and more especially after his consulship! It was
with his support that Ι carried through an affair,
which was for all men's interest rather than my own.³
