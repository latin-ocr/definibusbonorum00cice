man’s mistrust of their conclusions was raised into a
system of Scepticism by Pyrrho. Meanwhile the
outer order too had changed. For Plato and Aris-
totle the good life could only be lived in a free
city-state, like the little independent Greek cities
which they knew; but these had now fallen under
the empire of Macedon, and the barrier between
Greek and barbarian was giving way. The wars of
Alexander’s successors rendered all things insecure;
exile, slavery, violent death were possibilities with
which every man must lay his account.

Epicureanism and Stoicism, however antagonistic,
have certain common features corresponding to the
needs of the period. Philosophy was systematized,
and fell into three recognized departments, Logic,
Physics and Ethics3 and for both schools the third
department stood first in importance. Both schools
offered dogma, not speculation; away of life for man
as man, not as Greek citizen. Both abandoned
idealism, saw no reality save matter, and accepted
sense experience as knowledge. Both studied the
world of nature only in order to understand the
position of man. Both looked for a happiness
secure from fortune’s changes3 and found it in peace
of mind, undisturbed by sear and desire. But here
the rival teachers diverged: Epicurus sought peace
in the liberation of man's will from nature’s law,
Zeno in submission to it31 and in their conceptions
of nature they differed profoundly.
