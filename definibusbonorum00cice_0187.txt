Virtue herself shall speak for me, and she will not
hesitate to rank Marcus Regulus higher than this
typically happy man, as you would call him. Regulus,
of his own free will and under no compulsion except
that of a promise given to an enemy, returned from
his native land to Carthage3 yet Virtue proclaims

consuls for the first year of the republie. Sixty years
after our liberties had been won, Lucius Verginius,
a poor man of humble station, killed his maiden
daughter with his own hand rather than surrender
her to the lust of Appius Claudius, who then held
the highest power in the state.
