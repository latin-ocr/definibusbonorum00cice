in themes demanding ornate and dignified treat-
ment, how imposing, how brilliant is their diction!
On Justice, Temperance, Courage, Friendship,on the
conduct of life, the pursuit of wisdom, the carcer
of the statesman,—no llair-splitting like that of the
Stoics, no niggling minutiae, but the loftier
passages studiously ornate, and the minor topics
studiously plain and clear. As a result, think οῖ’
their consolations, their exhortations‚ even thcir
warnings and counsels, addressed to men of the
lnghestennnence! In stust‚theirrhetoncalexercsses

new words, discarding those approved by use. ς But‚’
you will say, ‘think how vast are the themes that
they essay! for example, that this entire universe is
our own town.’² You see the magnitude of
a Stoic's task, to convince an inhabitant of Circeii
that the whole vast world is his own borough! ⁶ lf
So, he must rouse his audience to enthusiasm.’
