has also engendered in mankind the desire of con-
templating truth. This is most clearly manifested

in our hours of leisure; when our minds are at

ease we are eager to acquire knowledge even of

the movements of the heavenly bodies. This
primary instinct leads us on to love all truth as such,
that is, all that is trustworthy, simple and consistent,
and to hate things insincere, false and decepthe,
such as cheating, perjury‚ malice and injustice.

Further, Reason possesses an intrinsic element of

dignity and grandeur, suited rather to require
obedience than to render it, estecming all the acci-
dents of human fortunes not merely as endurable
but also as unimportant; a quality of loftiness and
elevation, fearing nothing, submitting to no one,
ever unsubdued. These three kinds of moral good-
ness being noted, there follows a fourth kind,
possessed of equal beauty‚ and indeed arising out
of the other three. This is the principle of order
and of restraint. From recognizing something
analogous to this principle in the beauty and dignity
of outward forms, we pass to beauty in the moral
sphere of speech and conduct. Each of the three
excellences mentioned before contributes something
to this fourth one: it dreads rashness; it shrinks
from injur-ing anyone by wanton word or deed ; and
it fears to do 01· say anything that may appear
unmanly.
