that the End of Goods is contained in virtue alone;
but if he has a body as well, the revelation of our
nature, on your showing, will actually have resulted
in our relinquishing the things to which we held
before that revelation took place. At this rate ‘to
live in harmony with nature¹ means to depart from
nature. There have been philosophers who, after
rising from sensation to the recognition of nobler
and more spiritual faculties, thereupon threw the
senses on one side. Similarly your friends next after
the instinctive desires came to behold virtue in all
her beauty, and forthwith flung aside all they had
ever seen besides virtue herself, forgetting that
the whole instinct of appetition is so wide in its
range that it spreads from the primary objects of
desire right up to the ultimate Ends, and not realiz-
ing that they are undermining the very foundations
of the graces which they so much admire.

so far as he allowed desire of some sort, but worse
than the rest because he departed so utterly from
nature. Now the Stoics in placing the End of
Goods in virtue alone resemble the philosophers
already mentioned3 but in trying to find a founda-
tion for virtuous action they are an improvement
