Stoicism: z'z‘s

friends as a college of students. It still survived
and kept the birthday of its founder in Cicero’s time.

Epicurus is the forerunner of the English Utilita-

rians; but he differs from them in making no attempt
to combine hedonism with altruism. ‘ The greatest

happiness of the greatest number ' is a formula that

as against its hedonistic basis that Cicero’s criticisms
are really directed.

The Stoics paid much attention to Logic. In this
department they included with Dialectic, which they
developed on the lines laid down by Aristotle,
Grammar, Rhetoric, and the doctrine of the Criterion.
The last was their treatment of the problem of know-

but unlike him they conceded to the Sceptics that
sensations are sometimes misleading. Yet true sensa-
tions,they maintained, are distinguishable from false;
they have a ⁶ clearness ' which compels the ‘assent’
of the mind and makes it ‘comprehend’ or grasp
the presentation as a true picture of the external
object. Such a ς comprehensible presentation,’

present, in conformity with that object, stamped on
the mind like the impress of a scal, and such as
could not arise from an object not actually p1·esent.'
So their much-debated formula was elaborated in
reply to Sceptical critics. If asked how it happens
