BOOK III. xiv

45 XIV. “The light of a lamp is eclipsed and over-
powered by the rays ofthe sun ; a drop of honey is lost
in the vastness of the Aegean sea 3 an additional six-
pence is nothing amid the wealth of Croesus, ora single
step in the journey from here to India. Similarly if
the Stoic definition of the End of Goods be accepted,
it follows that all the value you set on bodily advan-
