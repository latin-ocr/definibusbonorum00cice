own efficacy and value desirable‚ whereas none of the
primary objects of nature is desirable forits own sake.
But since those actions which I have termed ⁶ appro-
priate acts ¹ are based 011 the primary natural objeets,
it follows that the former are means to the latter.
Hence it may correctly be said that all ⁶ appropriate
acts ' are means to the end of attaining the primary
needs of nature. Yet it must not be infel-red that their
attainment is the ultimate Good, inasmuch as moral
action is not one of the primary natural attractions,
but is an outgrowth of these, a later development, as
l have said. At the same time moral actionis in accord-
ance with nature, and stimulates our desire far more
strongly than all the objeets that attracted us earlier.
But at this point a caution is necessary at the outset.
It will be an error to infer that this view implies tnvo
Ultimate Goods. For though if a man were to make
it his purpose to take a true aim with a spear or
arrow at some mark, his ultimate end, corresponding
to the ultimate good as we pronouuce it, would be
to do all he could to aim straight: the man in this
illustration would have to do everything to aim
straight, and yet, although he did everything to
attain his purpose, his ‘ ultimate E11d‚’ so to speak,
would be what corresponded to what we call the
Chief Good in the conduct of life, whereas the actual
hitting of the mark would be in our phrase ‘to be
chosen’ but not ‘ to be desired.'
