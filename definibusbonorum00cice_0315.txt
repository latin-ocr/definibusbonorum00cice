an affection for their children : and parental affec-
tion is the source to which we trace the origin of the
association of the human race 111 communities. This
cannot but be clear in the first place from the con-
formation of the body and its members, which by
themselves are enough to show that nature’s scheme
included the procreation of offspring. Yet it could
not be consistent that nature should at once intend
offspring to be born and make 110 provision sor that

called, in its roomy 511611, and the creature named
the ‘ pinoteres ’ because it keeps watch over the sea—
