would own defeat, Vanquished by the arguments
of our preceding Book, she would yield the victory
to true Worth. Indeed she would be lost to shame
if she persisted any longer in the battle against
Virtue, and rated what is pleasant above what is
morally good, or maintained that bodily enjoynient
01 the mental gratification which springs from it is
of higher value than firmness and dignity ofcharacter.

Let us then give Pleasure 1161 dismissal, and bid her
keep within her own (1011131115, lest her charnis and
blandishments put suares in the way of strict philo-

that Chief Good, which is the object of our inquiry,
to be found? Pleasure we have eliminated3 the
doctrine that the End of Goods consists 111 freedom

in fact no Chief Good could be accepted that was

without the clement of Virtue, the most excellent

thing that can exist.
Hence although in our debate with Torquatus Stoicism
