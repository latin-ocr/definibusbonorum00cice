interests as dear as his own, while others say that a
man’s own interests must necessarily be dearer to
him; at the same time the latter admit that to en-
rich oneself by another’s loss is an action repugnant
to that justice towards which we seem to possess a
natural propensity. But the school Ι am discussing
emphatically rejects the view that we adopt or ap—
prove either justice οι· friendship for the sake of
their utility. For isit were so, the same claims of
utility would be able to undermine and overthrow
them. In fact the very existence of both justice
and friendship will be impossible if they are not

71 desired for their own sake. Right moreover, properly
so styled and entitled, exists (they aver) by nature ;
and it is foreign to the nature of the Wise Man not
only to wrong but even to hurt anyone.. Nor again
is it righteous to enter into a partnership in wrong-
doing with one’s friends or benefactors; and it is
most truly and cogently maintained that honesty
is always the best policy, and that whatever is fair
and just is also honourable,b and conversely whatever
is honourable b will also be just and fair.

 

b'she sense seems here to require utile, ⁴useful‚’ rather
than honestum: unless honestum is intended to mean ‘ held
in popular esteern‚' and so profitable.
