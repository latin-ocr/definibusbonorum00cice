INTRODUCTION

the criter'idn of truth, is furnished by the sensations
and by the πάθη 01· feeling-s of pleasure and pain.
Epicurus's recognition of the latter as qualities of
any state of consciousness and as distinct from the
sensations of sight, hearing, etc„ marks a notable
advance in psychology. 'lhe sensations and the
feelings determine our judgment and volition
respectively, and they are all ‘truej i..‚e real data
of experience. So are the προλήψεις, or ‘precon-
ceptions' by which we recognize each fresh sensa-
tion, i.e.‚ our general concepts; sor these are accu-
mulations of past sensations. It is in ὑπολήψεις,
‘opinions‚’ i.e., judgments about sensations‚ that
error can occur. Opinions are true only when con-
firmed, or, in the case of those relating to imper-
ceptible objects (eg. the void), when not contra-
dicted, by actual sensations. Thus Epicurus adum-
brated, however crudely, a logie of inductive
science.
His Natural Philosophy is touched on in dc Finibus, Epicurean

I, c. vi. It is fully set out in the grcat poem ofPlzysics.
Cicero’s contemporary, Lucretius, who prcaches his
master’s doctrine with religious fem-our as a gospcl
of deliverance for the spirit of man. Epicurus adopt-
ed the Atomic theory of Democritus, according to
which the primary realities are an infinite number of
tiny particles of matter, indivisible and indestructi-
ble, moving by their own weight through an infinite
expanse of empty space or Void. Our perishable
world and all that it contains consists of tempor-ary
clusters of these atoms interspersed with void. In-
numerable other worlds beside are constantly form-
ing and dissolving. This universe goes on of itsclf:
there are gods, but they take no part in its guidance3
