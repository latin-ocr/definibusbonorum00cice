BOOK Ι. iii-iv

Mucius's sarcasm was however deserved. But for
my part I can never cease wondering what can be
the origin of the exaggerated contempt for home pro-
ducts that is now fashionable. It would of course
be out of place to attempt to prove it herc, but 111 my
opinion, as I have often argued, the Latin languagc,
so far from having a poor vocabulary, as is commonly
supposed, is actually richer than the Greek. When
have we, that is to say when have our competent
orators or poets, at all events since they have had
models to copy, ever lacked any of the resources
either of the florid or the chaste style?

lv. In my own case,just as Ι trust Ι have done
my duty, at the post to which the Roman people

toils and dangers I have under-gone, so it is as-
suredly incumbent 011 me also to use my best
endeavours, with such zeal, enthusiasm and energy
as I possess, to promote the advancement of learning
among my fellow-counti-ymen. Nor need Ι be greatly
concerned to joiri issue with any who prefer to read
Greek, provided that they actually do read it and do
not merely pretend to do so. It is my business to
serve those who desire to enjoy literature 111 both
languages, or who, if books 111 their own are 1111111-
able, do not feel any great need of Greek ones.
'l'hose again who would rather have me write 011
other subjects may fairly be indulgent to one who
has written much already-in fact no one of our
nation more—and who perhaps will write still more
if his life be prolonged. And even were it not so,
anyone who has been a careful student of my philo-
sophical writings will pronounce that none of them
are better worth reading than the present treatise.
