BOOK III. xxi-xxii

“ To the virtues we have discussed they also add hogio and
Dialectic and Natural Philosophy. Both of these ὶῖζῆιὲζὲἒω m,
they entitle by the name of virtue3 the former Vstfflffi·
because it conveys a method that guards us from
giving assent to any falsehood οι· ever being deceived
by specious probability, and enables us to retain
and to defend the truths that we have learned about
good and evil ; for without the art of Dialectic
they hold that any man may be seduced from truth
into error. If therefore rashness and ignorance are
in all matters fraught with misc-hies, the art which
removes them is correctly entitled a virtue.

XXII. “The same honour is also bestowed with
good reason upon Natural Philosophy, because he
who is to live in accordance with nature must base
his principles upon the system and government of
the entire world. Nor again can anyone judge truly
of things good and evil, save by a knowledge of the
whole plan of nature and also of the life of the gods,
and of the answer to the question whether the
nature of man is or is not in harmony with that of
the universe. And no one without Natural Philo-
sophy can discern the value (and their value is very
great) of the ancient maxims and precepts of the
Wise Men, such as to ‘ obey occasion,' ‘ follow God‚’
⁶ know thyself,' and ‘moderation in all ’things’ Also
this science alone can impart a conception of the
power of nature in fostering justice and maintaining
friendship and the rest of the affections3 nor again
without unfolding nature's secrets can we understand
the sentiment of piety towards the gods or the
degree of gratitude that we owe to them.
