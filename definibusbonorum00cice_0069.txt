pul-sues or desires to obtain pain of itsclf, because it
t‘s pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur
in which toil and pain can procure him some great
pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us cvcr
undertakes laborious physica] exercisc, except to ob-
tain some advantage from it? But who has any right
to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a plea-
sure that has no annoying consequenccS, or one who
avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure? On
the other hand, we denounce with righteous indigna-
tion and dislike men who are so beguiled and demora-
lized by the charms of the pleasure of the moment, so
blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain
and trouble that are bound to cnsue3 and equal blame
belongs to those who fail in their duty through
weakness of will, which is the same as saying through
shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are per-
fectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour,
when our power of choice is untrammellcd and when
nothing prevents our being able to do what we like
best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every
pain avoided. But in certain emergencies and
owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of
business it will frequently occur that plcasures have
to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise
man therefore always holds in these matters to this
principle of selecti0n: he rejects pleasures to secure
other greater pleasuoes, or else he endures pains to
avoid worse pains.
