INTRODUCTION.

The de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum is a treatise The de Fini·
on the theory of Ethics. It expounds and criticizes ¹¹⁵
the three ethical systems most prominent in Cicero's
day, the Epicurean, the Stoic and that of the Aca-
demy under Antiochus. The most elaborate of
Cicero's philosophical writings, it has had fewer
readers than his less technical essays on moral sub-
jects. But it is of importance to the student of philo-
sophy as the only systematic account surviving
from antiquity of those rules of life which divided
the allegiance of thoughtful men during the cen-
turies when the old religions had lost their hold and
Christianity had not yet emerged. And the topics
that it handles can never lose their interest.

The title ‘About the Ends of Goods and Evils' 77²2 meqning
requires explanation. It was Aristotle who put the ⁰f²⁴he “tle''
ethical problem in the form of the question, What
is the Τέλος or End, the supreme aim of man's en-
deavour, in the attainment of which his Good or
Well-being lies? For Aristotle, Telos connoted not
only ‘aimj but ‘completion’; and he found the
answer to his question in the complete development
and right exercise of the faculties of man’s nature,
and particularly of the distinctively human faculty
of Reason. The life of the Intellect was the Best,
the Chief Good3 and lesser Goods were Means to
the attainment of this End. Thus was introduced
the notion of an ascending scale of Goods, and this
affected the interpretation of the term Telos. T ez'os
came to be understood as deuoting not so much the
end or aim of endeavour as the end or extreme
