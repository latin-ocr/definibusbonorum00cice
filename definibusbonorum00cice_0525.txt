BOOK V. xxix

no one doubted that all hope alike of right conduct
and of happiness lay in virtue. Zeno haring learnt
this doctrine from our school proceeded to deal with
⁶ the same matter in another manner,' as the common
preamble ³ to an indictment has it. You now approve
of this procedure on his part. He, 110 doubt, ean
change the names of things and be aequitted of in-
consistency, but we cannot! He denies that the life
of Metellus was happier than that of Regulus, yet
calls it ⁶ preferable ' ; not more desirable‚ but ‘ more
worthy of adoption’ 3 and given the choice, that of
Metellus is ‘to be selected’ and that of Regulus
‘rejected’ Whereas the life he called‘preferable‘ and
‘ more worthy to be selected’ Ι term happier, though Ι
do not assign any the minutest fraction more value to

89 that life than do the Stoics. What is the difference,
except that I call familiar things familiar names,
whereas they invent new terms to express the same
meaning? Thus just as in the senate there is always
some one who demands an interpreter,b so we must
use an interpreter when we give audience to your
school. Ι call whatever is in accordance with nature
good and what is contrary to nature bad; nor am I
alone in this ε you, Chrysippus, do so too in business
and in private life, but you leave off doing so in the
lecture-room. What then? do you think philo-
sophers should speak a different language from
ordinary human beings? The learned and the un-
learned may differ as to the values of things; but
when the learned are agreed what each thing's value
is,—if they were human beings, they would adopt the
recognized form of expression3 but so long as the
substance remains the same,—let them coin new
words at their pleasure.
