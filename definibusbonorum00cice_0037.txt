BOOK I. i-ii

The second class of critics, who, however much they and οἱ
approve of philosophy, ncverthelcss would rather thoroughszudy
have it less eagerly prosecuted, are asking for a
restraint that it is not easy to practise. The study

is one that when once taken up admits of no restriction

or control. In fact, the attitude of the former class,

who attempt to dissuade us from philosophy alto—
gether, seems almost less unreasonable thau that of
those who would set limits to what is essentially un-
limited, and expect us to stop half-way in a study

that inereases in value the further it proceeds. If
Wisdom be attainable, let us not only win but enjoy

it3 or if attainment be diffie-ult, still there is no end

to the search for truth, other than its discovery. lt
were base to flag in the pursuit, when the object pur-
suedis so supremely lovely. Indeed ifwe like writing,

who would be so churlish as to debar us from it? Or

if we find it a labour, who is to set limits to another
man’s exertions? No doubt it is kind of Chremes
in Terence's play to wish his new neighbour not
To dig or plough or any burden bearn:

for it is not industry in general, but toil of a menial
kind, from which he would deter him3 but only a
busybody would take exception to an occupation
which, like mine, is a labour of love.

about them is thia—why should they dislike their
native language for serious and important subjects,
when they are quite willing to read Latin plays trans-
lated word for word from the Greek ? Who has such
a hatred, one might almost say for the very name of

Roman, as to despise and reject the Jsedea of Ennius
