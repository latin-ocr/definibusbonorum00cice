BOOK I. iv-v

For what problem does life offer so important as all
the topics of philosophy, and especially the question
raised in these volumes——What is the End, the final
and ultimate aim, which gives the standard for all
principles of well-being and ofright conduct? What
does Nature pursue as the thing supremely desii-able,
what does she avoid as the ultimate evil? It is
a subject on which the most learned philosophers
disagree profoundly3 who then can think it de-
rogatory to such esteem as each may assign to
me, to investigate what is the highest good and the
truest rule in every relationsliip of life? Are we to
have our leading statesmcn debating such topics as
whether the offspring of a female slave is to be con-
sidered as belonging to the party who has hired her,
Publius Scaevola and Manius Manilius upholding
one opinion and Marcus Brutus the contrary (not but
what such discussions raise nice points of law, as
well as being of practical importance for the business
of life3 and we read and shall continue to read with
pleasure the treatises in question and others of the
same nature); and shall these questions which cover
the entire range of conduct be neglected? Legal
subjects are no doubt inore popular, but philosophy
is unquestionably richer in interest. However‚
this is a point that may be lest to the reader to
decide. In the present work we believe we
have given a more or less exhaustive exposition
of the whole subject of the Ends of Goods and
Evils. The book is intended to contain so far as
possible a complete account, not only of the views
that we ourselves accept, but also of the doctrines
enunciated by all the different schools of philosophy.
