took me further back, for Ι had a vision of Oedipus,
advancing towards this very spot and asking in those
most tender verses,d ζ that place is this ? ’-—a mere

attacking me as a devotee of Epicurus, and I do
spend much of my time with Phaedrus, who as you
know is my dearest friend, in Epicurus’s Gai-dense
which we passedjust now; but Ι obey the old saw:1

forget Epicurus, even if Ι wanted3 the members of
our body not only have pictures of him, but even
have his likeness on their drinking-cups and rings.''
