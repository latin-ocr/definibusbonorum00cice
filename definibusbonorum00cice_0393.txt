clusions? That those who are not wise are all

equally wretched3 that the wise are all supremely

happy3 that all right actions are equal, all sins

sound at a first hearing, but upon examination they

but Plato has hopes of it, and had better live.

Again, he allows that some sins are endurable, while

others are unpardonable, because some sins transgress

more and others fewer points of duty3 moreover
