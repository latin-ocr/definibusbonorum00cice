point of a series, the topmost good. To this was
naturally opposed an extreme of minus value, the
topmost, or rather bottommost, evil. Hence arose
the expressions τέλος ἀγαθῶν, τέλος κακῶν, ‘End of
Goods, of Evils,’ which occur in Philodemus, Rlzetoric
Ι, 218. 8 ff. (Siidhans), and are translated by Cicero
finis bonorum, malornm. As a title for his book he
throws this phrase into the plural, meaning ‘dzff'erent

title and to some extent in method, the de Finibus
may be compared with such modern works as
Martineau's Types of Ethical Theorjy and Sidgwiek's

Cicero belongs to a type not unknown in English
life, that of the statesman who is also a student and a
writer. From his youth he aspired to play a part in
public affairs, and the first step towards this ambition

‘omnibus eis finibus bonorum quos exposui malorum
finis esse contrarios’; although ib. ΙΙ, 114, ‘fines bonorum
et malorum instituas' means ‘finem bonorum et finem
malorum‚’ and some scholars so interpret the phrase in the
present titles: see Philippson Plzilologisclze Wochensclzrz'ft,
1913, p. 613 (published after the first edition of this book
had gone to press) and ib. 1923, p. 11. Α
