BOOK V. xiii

faculties both of mind and body to be perfect,

those faculties are themselves dear to us for their

own sakes, and are of the highest importanee for

our general well-being. For he who aims at the
preservation of himself, must necessarily feel an affec-

tion for the parts of himself also, and the more so,

the more perfect and admirable in their own kind

they are. For the life we desire is one fully equipped

with the virtues of mind and body3 and such a life

must constitute the Chief Good, inasmuch as it must
necessarily be such as to be the limit of things desir-

able. This truth realized, it cannot be doubted that,

as men feel an affection towards themselves for their

own sakes and of their own accord, the parts also of

the body and mind, and of those faculties which are
displayed in each while in motion or at rest, are
esteemed for their own attractiveness and desired

38 for their own sake. From these explanations, it especially of

may readily be inferred that the most desirable of ss‘ssffissffigtffiss3
our faculties are those possessed of the highest “3³⁵0n· the
intrinsic worth; so that the most desirable excel· 21¹}ssssss putot
lences are the excellences of the noblest parts of us,

which are desii-able for their own sake. The result

will be that excellence of mind will be rated higher

than excellence of body, and the volitional virtues

of the mind will surpass the non-volitional ; the

former, indeed, are the ‘ virtues ' specially so called,

and are far superior, in that they spring from reason,

the most divine clement in man. For the inanimate

or nearly inanimate creatures that are under nature's

charge, all of them have their supreme good in the

body 3 hence it has been cleverly said,as I think‚about

the pig, that a mind has been bestowed upon this

animal to serve as salt and keep it from going bad.
