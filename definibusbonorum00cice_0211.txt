lose them and be miset-able. But no one can be
87 happy who is uneasy about matters of the highest
moment. Therefore no one can be happy at all.
For we usually speak of a life as a happy one not in
reference to a part of it, but to the whole of a life-
time ; indeed ‘ a life ’ means a finished and complete
life 3 noris itpossible to be at one time happy and at
another miserable‚ since he who thinks that he may
be miserable will not be happy. For when happiness
has once been achieved, it is as permanent as Wisdom
itself, which is the efficient cause of happiness3 it does
not wait for the end of our mortal term, as Croesus
in Herodotus' 5 history was w arned by Solon to do.
“It may be rejoined that Epicurus, as 3ou >our-naarrethatp1ea-
self were saying, maintains that long duration caniS ζξςεάῑὺγ
not add anything to happiness, and that as much :ilict ration,
pleasure is enjoyed in a b1ief span of time as if
88 pleasure were everlasting. In this he is grossly
inconsistent. He places the Chief Good in pleasure,
and yet he says that no greater pleasure would
result from a lifetime of endless duration than from
a limited and moderate period. If a person finds
the sole Good in Virtue, it is open to him to say that
the happy life is consummated by the consummation
of Virtue3 for his position is that the Chief Good
is not increased by lapse of time. But if one thinks
that happiness is produced by pleasure‚ how can
he consistently deny that pleasure is increased by
duration ? If it is not, pain is not either. Or if pain
is worse the longer it lasts, is not pleasure rendered
more desirable by continuance? On what ground
then does Epicurus speak of the Deity (for so he
always does) as happy and everlasting? Take away his

everlas2ting life, and Jove is no happier than Epffiuruffi
