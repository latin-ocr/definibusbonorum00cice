BOO K lv. viii

the virtues of these are to be taken for their own
sakes? Or again, did he take exception to the
ascription of such pre-eminence to the virtues of the
soul? or to what they say about prudence and
knowledge, about the sense of human fellowship, or
about temperance, sels-control, magnanimity, and
moral virtue in general? No, the Stoies will admit
that all of these doctrines are admirable, and that
Zeno’s reason for secession did not lie here. As Ι
understand, they will accuse the ancients of certain
grave errors in other matters, which that ardent
seeker after truth found himself quite unable to
tolerate. What, he asked, could have been more
insufferably foolish and perverse than to take good
health, freedom from all pain, or soundness of eye-
sight and of the other senses, and class them as
goods, instead of saying that there was nothing
whatever to choose between these things and their
opposites? According to him, all these things
which the ancients called good, were not good, but
‘preferred’3 and so also with bodily exeellenees, it
was foolish of the ancients to call them ‘desirable
for their own sakes'3 they were not ‘desii-able’
but ‘worth taking’3 and in short, speaking
generally, a life bountifully supplied with all the
other things in accordance with nature, in addition
to virtue, was not ‘ more desirable,’ but only ‘inore
worth taking’ than a life of virtue and virtue
alone; and although virtue of itsclf ean render
life as happy as it is possible for it to be, yet
there are some things that Wise Men lack at the
very moment of supreme happiness ; and accordingly
they do their best to protect themselves from pain,
discase and infirmity.
