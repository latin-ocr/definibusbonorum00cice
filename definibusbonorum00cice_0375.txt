faculty of reason. For she continually superadds
fresh faculties without abandoning her previous gifts.

38 Thus she added to sensation reason, and after
creating reason did not discard sensation. Suppose
the art of viticulture, whose function is to bring the
vine with all its parts into the most thriving con-
dition—at least let us assume it to be so (for we
may invent an imaginary case, as you are fond of
doing, for purposes of illustration); suppose then
the art of viticulture were a faculty residing in the
vine itself, this faculty would doubtless desire every

before, but would rank itself above all the other
parts of the vine, and would consider itself the
noblest elenlent in the vine’s organism. Similarly
when an animal organism has acquired the faculty

been superadded, this is placed in such a position of
dominance that all those primary gifts of nature are

39 placed under its protection. Accordingly Reason
never abandons its task of safeguarding the earlier
elements; its business is by controlling these to
steer the whole course of life3 so that I cannot
sufficiently marvel at the inconsistency of your
teachers. Natural desire, which they terni horme,
and also duty, and even virtue itself they reckon
among things according to Nature. Yet when they
want to arrive at the Supreme Good, they leap over
all of these, and leave us with two tasks instead of
