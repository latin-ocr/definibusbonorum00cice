BOOK Ι. vi

this process result the whole of the things that exist
and that we see. Moreover, this movenient of the
atonis must not be conceived as siai-ting froin a be-
ginning, but as having gone on from all eternity.
1& Epicurus for his part, where he follows Democritus,
does not generally blunder. Still, there is a great
deal in each of them with which Ι (10 not agree, and
especially this: in the study of Nature there are two
questions to be asked, first, what is the matter out
of which each thing is made,second‚ what is the force
by which it is made 3 now Democritus and Epicurus
have discussed the question of matter, but they have
not considered the question of force or the efficient
cause. But this is a defect shared hy both3 I now
come to the lapses peculial· to Epicurus. He believes
that these same indivisible solid bodies are borne by
their own weight perpendicularly downward, which
19 he holds is the natural motion of all bodies; but
thereupon this elever fellow, being met with the
difficulty that if they all travelled downwards in
a straight line, and> as I said, perpendicularly, no one
atoni would ever be able to overtake any other atoni.
accordingly introduced an idea of his own invention :
he said that the atom makes a very tiny swerve,
-the smallest divergence possible: and so are pro·
duced entanglenients and combinations and cohe-
sions ofatoms with atoms, which result in the creation
of the world and all its parts, and of all that in then]
is. Now not only is the whole of this affair a piece
of childish fancy, but it does not even achieve the
result that its author desires. The swerving is itself
an arbitrary fiction3 for Epicurus says the atonis
swerve without a cause‚—yet this is the capital
offence in a natural philosopher, to speak of some·
