BOOK IV. xviii

‘ Everything good is praiseworthy 3 but everything
praiseworthy is lnorally honourable3 therefore
everything good is morally honourable.' What a
dagger of lead! Why, who will grant you your
major premise? (and if this be granted there is
no need of the minor3 for if everything good is
praiseworthy‚ then everything good is honourable).
Who, I say, will grant you this, except Pyrrho,
Aristo and their fellows, whose doctrines you reject?
Aristotle, Xenocrates and the whole of their follow-

strength, riches, fame and many other things good,
but do not call them praiseworthy. And these,
though holding that the End of Goods is not
limited to virtue alone, yet rate virtue higher than
all other things; but what do you suppose will be
the attitude of those who entirely dissociated virtue
from the End of Goods, Epicurus, Hieronymus
and also of any supporters of the End of Carneades?
Or how will Callipho or Diodorus be able to grant
your premise, who combine with Moral &Vorth
another factor belonging to an entirely different
category? Are you then content, Cato. to take
disputed premises for granted, and draw from these
any conclusion you want? And again, the following
proof is a sorites, which according to you is a most
fallacious form of reasoning: ⁵ what is good is to be
wished; what is to be wished is desirable3 what is
desirable is praiseworthy'3 and so on through the
remaining steps, but I call a halt at this one, for, just
as before, no one will grant you that what is desira-
ble is praiseworthy. As for your other argument, it
is by no means a ‘consequence,’ but stupid to a
degree, though, of course, the Stoie leaders and not
