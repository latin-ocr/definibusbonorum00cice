BOOK III. xiv-xv

health is estimated by duration, that of virtue is
measured by opportuneness3 so that those who use
the argument in question might equally be expected
to say that an easy death or an easy child-birth would
be better if protracted than if speedy. They fail to
see that some things are rendered more valuable

48 by brevity as others bv prolongation. So it would
be consistent with the principles alieady stated that
on the theory of those who deem the End of Goods,Wisc10min·ca
that which we teim the extreme οι· ultimate Good, pame ofd mg ee,
to be capable of degree, they should also hold
that one man can be wiser than another, and simi-
larly that one can commit a more sinful or morc
righteous action than another; which it is not open
to us to say, who do not think that the End of
Goods can vary in degree. For just as a drowning
man is no more able to breathe if he be not far from
the surface of the water, so that he might at any
moment emerge, than if he were actually at the
bottom already, and just as a puppy 011 the point of
opening its eyes is no less blind than one just born,
similarly a man that has made some progress towards
the state of virtue is none the less in misery than he
that has made no progress at all.

and well established, and as these are the logical ἐπ’
inferences from them, the truth of these inserences
also cannot be called in question. Y et although the
Stolos deny that either virtues or vices can be in-
creased in degree, they nevertheless believe that
each of them can be in a sense expanded and

49 widened in scope.a Wealth again, in the opinion of Weam.
