our nature, and they sprout and blossom into
virtue. For we are so constituted from birth as to
contain within us the primary instincts of action, of
affection, of liberality and of gratitude3 we are also
gifted with minds that are adapted to knowledge,
prudence and courage, and averse from their oppo-

children those sparks of virtue I have mentioned,
from which the philosopher⁷s torch of reason must
be kindled, that he may follow reason as his divine
guide and so arrive at nature's goal. For as I have
repeatedly said already, in the years of immaturity
when the intellect is weak the powers of our nature
are discerned as through a inist3 but as the mind
grows older and stronger it learns to know the
capacity of our nature, while recognizing that this
nature is susceptible of further development and has
by itself only reached an incomplete condition.

to have emanated from a human being, and it was
therefore ascribed to a god. Accordingly the
Pythian Apollo bids us ‘learn to know ourselves'3
but the sole road to sels-knowledge is to know
our powers of body and of mind, and to follow the

path of life that gives us their full employment.
