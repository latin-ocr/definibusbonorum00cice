32 For proof of this, how'gexex Epicurus cannot have
gone to children nor yet to aniin z,11s which according
to him hold a mirror up to nature ; he could
hardly say that natural instinct guides the young
to desire the pleasure of i'reedom from pain. This
cannot excite appetition; the ‘static ’ condition of
feeling no pain exerts no driving-power, supplies
no impulse to the will (so that Hieronymus also is
wrong here); it is the positive sensation of pleasure
and delight that furnishes a motive. Accordingly
Epicurus's standing argument to prove that pleasure
is naturally desired is that infants and animals are
attracted by the ‘kinetic’ sort of pleasure, not the
‘ static ⁷ kind which consists merely in freedom from
pain. Surely then it is inconsistent to say that
natural instinct starts from one sort of pleasure, but
that the Chief Good is found in another.
