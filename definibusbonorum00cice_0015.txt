INTRODUCTION

adding illustrations from Roman history and poetry.
He puts the matter frankly in a letter to Atticus
(XII, 52): “You will say, ‘What is your method in
such compositions?' They are mere transcripts, and
eost comparatively little labour; Ι only supply the
words, of which I have a copious flow.'' ln de Finibus
(Ι, 6) he rates his work a little higher, not without
justice, and claims to be the critic as well as the
interpreter of his authorities.

This method of writing was consonant with Cicero's Cz'qcro's ὑ
own position in philosophy. Since his early studies phz{;>sopl11‹<c1l
under Philo he had been a professed adherent of the pom ’Μ’
New Academy, and as such maintained a sccptical
attitude on questions os knowledge. On morals he
was more positive3 though without a logical basis for
his principles, he accepted the vex-dict os the common
moral conscience of his age and country. Epicure-
anism he abhorred as demoralizing. The Stoics
repelled him by their harshness and narrowncss, hut
attracted him by their strict morality and lofty the-
ology. His competence for the task of interpreting
Greek thought to Rome was of a qualificd order.
He had read much, and had heard the chief tem-hers
of the day. But with learning and enthusiasm he
combined neither depth of insight nor scientific
precision. Yet his services to philosophy must not
be underrated. He introduced a novel style of ex-
position, copious, eloquent, impartial and urbane;
and he created a philosophical terminology in Latin
which has passed into the languages of modern
Europe.

The de Finibus consists of three separate dialogues, Contents oj'
each dealing with one of the chief ethical systems de Finibus.
