ΒΟΟΚ ΙΙ. xxi

XXI. “ Either, Torquatus, you must reprobate Epicureanism
such actions, or you must give up your championship {fissffissffgffig
of Pleasure. But what defence can Pleasure offer, oi history
what case can you make out for her, when she will
be able to produce no famous men as her witnesses
or supporters? On our side we cite in evidence
from our records and our annals men who spent their
whole lives in glorious toils, men who would not have
borne to hear pleasure so much as named ; but
in your discourses history is dunib. In the school of
Epicurus I never heard one mention of Lycurgus,
Solon, Miltiades, Themistocles, Epaminondas, who
are always on the lips of the other philosophers. And
now that we Romans too have begun to treat of these
thenies, what a marvellous roll of great men will our
friend Atticus supply to us from his store-houses of
learning 1³ would it not be bcttcr to talk of these than
to devote those bulky volumes to Themista? Let us
leave that sort of thing to the Greeks. True we owe
to them philosophy and all the liberal sciences; yet
there are topics not permitted to us, that are allow-
able for them. Battle rages between the Stoics and
the Peripatetics. One school declares that nothing
is good but Moral worth, the other that, while it
assigns the greatest, and by far the greatest, value
to Morahty, yct still some bodily and external things
are good. Here is an honour-able quarrel, fought out
in high debate 1 For the whole dispute turns on the
true worth of virtue. But when one argues with
your friends, one has to listen to a great deal about
even the grosser forms of pleasure! Epicurus is

69 always harping upon them ! Believe me then, Tor· It paints the

quatus, if you will but look within, and study your ζὲῗέἑζῗὲςᾞῗ
own thoughts and inclinations‚ you cannot con· Pieasure.
