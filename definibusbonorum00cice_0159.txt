only.

XIII. “Guided by the authority of Reason Ι will
now adopt 3 similar procedure myself. As far 35
possible I will narrow the issue, aud will assume
that all the simple theorics, of those who include
no admixture of virtue, are to be eliniinated from
philosophy altogether. First among these comes
the system of Aristippus and the Cyrenaic school

Chief Good in pleasure of the sort that excites
the highest amount of actively agreeable sensation,

and who despised your freedom from pain. They

for hunting, so inan, as Aristotle observes, is born for

which we all of us employ the term to be not merely
the highest but the sole pleasure that exists. Your
school holds a different view. However, as Ι said,
Aristippus is wrong. Neither man’s bodily con-
formation nor his surpassing mental faculty of reason
indicates that he was born for the sole purpose of en-
joying pleasure. Nor yet can we listen to Hierony-
mus, whose Chief Good is the same as is occasionally,
or rather only too frequently, upheld by yourselves,
freedom from pain. If pain is an evil, to be without

this evil is not enough to constitute the Good Life.
