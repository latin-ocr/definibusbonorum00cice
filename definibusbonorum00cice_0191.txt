tinue to defend the doctrines you profess. You
will be put to the blush, Ι say, by the picture that
Cleanthes used to draw so cleverly in his lectures.
He would tell his audience to imagine a paint-
ing representing Pleasure, decked as a queen, and
gorgeously apparelled, seated on a throne; at her
side should stand the Virtues as her handmaffls,
who should make it their sole object and duty to
minister to Pleasure‚ merely whispering in her ear
the warning (provided this could be conveyed by the
painter’s art) to beware of unwittingly doing aught
to offend public opinion, or anything from which pain
might result. ‘As for us Virtues, we were born to
be your slaves3 that is our one and only business.'

Epicurus says or denies l What I ask is, what is it
consistent for a man to say who places the Chief
Good in pleasure? What reason can you give for
thinking that Thorius, or Postumius of Chios, or the
master of them all, Orata, did not live extremely
pleasant lives? Epicurus himself says that the life
of sensualists is blameless, if they are not utter
fools—for that is what his proviso, if they are free
from fear and from desire,' amounts to. And, as he
offers an antidote for both desire and fear, he vir-
tually offers free indulgence for sensuality. Eliminate
those passions, he says, and he cannot find anything
to blame in a life of profligacy. Consequently you
Epicuream, by taking pleasure as the sole guide,
make it impossible for yourselves either to uphold
or to retain virtue. For a man is not to be thought
good and just who refrains from doing wrong to

virtue.
