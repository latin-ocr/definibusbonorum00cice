BOOK II. xxix-xxx

be considered a disgrace‚ I do not say to feel pain
(that is sometimes inevitable)‚ but that ‘rock of
Lemnos to outrage’² with the eries of a Philoctetes,

Till the dumb stones utter a voice of weeping,
Echoing his wails and plaints, his sighs and
groanlngs.

Let Epicurus soothe with his spells, if he can, the
man whose

Veins and vitals, from the viper’s fang
Envenom’d, throb with pangs of anguish dire,
in this way: ‘Philoctetes! If pain is severe, it is
short.' Oh, but he hasbeen languishing in his cave
these ten years past. ‘ If it is long, it is light: for

95 it grants intervals of respite.’ In the first place,
this is not often the case ; and secondly, what is the
good of a respite embittered by recent pain still
fresh in memory, and tormented by fear of pain
impending in the future? Let him die, says Epicu-
rus. Perhaps that were the best course, but what
becomes of the maxim about ‘ a constant preponder-
ance ofpleasure ’? If that be true, are you not guilty
of a crime in advising him to end his life ? Well,
then, let us rather tel] him that it is base and un-
manly to let pain demoralize‚ crush and conquer
one. As for the formula of your sect, ‘Short if
it's strong, light if it’s long‚' it is a tag for copy-
books. Virtue, magnanimity, endurance, courage,

—it is these that have baim to assuage pain.
