BOOK IV. xxi

while some are those whieh are objects of pleasure
in every living creature, but in man are objects of
the reason also ³3 those which are dependent on the
reason are called honourable, beautiful, praise-
worthy3 but the former class are called natural,
the class which coupled with things morally worthy
render happiness perfect and complete. They fur-
ther hold that of all those advantages, which they
who call thern goods rate no more highly than does
Zeno who says they are not goods, by far the most
excellent is Moral Worth and what is praise-
worthy; but if one is offered the choice between
Mora] &Vorth plus health and Moral worth plus
disease, there is no doubt to which of the two Nature
herself will guide us3 though at the sanie time
Moral Worth is so potent, and so overwhelmingly
superior to all other things, that no penalties or
rewards can induce it to swerve from what it has
decided to be right3 and all apparent hardships,
difficulties and obstacles can be trodden under soot
by the virtues with which nature has adorned us3
not that these hardships are easily overcome or to
be made light of (else where were the merit of
virtue ?)‚ but so as to lead us to the verdict that
these things are not the main factor inour happi-
ness or the reverse. In fine, the ancients entitle
the same things ‘good’ that Zeno pronounced
‘valuable,' ‘to be adopted,’ and ‘suited to nature’;

 

sentence will then run: ‘Things in aecordance with nature,
which the Stoics pronounce neither moral nor praiseworthy‚
(1) in plants excite none of the appetition of which we have*
often spoken, but (2) in animals excite volition‚ and parli-

cularly (3) in man excite the reason also (Le. arethe objects
of rational choice).‘
