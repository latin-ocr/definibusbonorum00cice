XI. But the only case in which it would be correct
to place the Chief Good in virtue alone is if there
existed a creature consisting solely of pure intellec-t,
with the further proviso that this intellect possessed
nothing of its own that was in accordance with

29 nature, as bodily health is. But it is impossible even

to imagine a sels-consistent picture of what such a
creature would be like.

‘⁴ lf on the contrary they urge that certain things
are so extremely small that they are eclipsed and lost
sight of altogether, we too admit this ; Epicurus also
says the same of pleasure, that the smallest pleasures
are often eclipsed and disappear. But things so im-
portant, permanent and numerous as the bodily
advantages in question are not in this category. On
the one hand therefore, with things so small as to
be eclipsed from view, we are often bound to admit
that it makes no difference to ns whether we have
them or not (just as, to take your illustration, it makes
no difference if you light a lamp in the sunshine,
or add sixpence to the wealth of Croesus); while on
the other hand, with things which are not so com·
pletely eclipsed, it may nevertheless be the case that
any difference they do make is not very great
(thus, if a man who has lived ten years enjoyably
were given an additional nionth of equally enjoy-
able life, the addition to his enjoyment, being of
some value, would be a good thing, but yet the re-
fusal of the addition does not forthwith annihilate
his happiness). Now bodily goods resemble rather
the latter sort of things. For they contribute some-
thing worth an effort to obtain; so that I think

Bodily and ex-
terna} goods are

not all eclipsed

by mental goods»
and if they were,
they still would
be included
among ‘things
according to
naturess
