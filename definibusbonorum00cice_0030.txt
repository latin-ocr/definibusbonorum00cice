INTRODUCTION

and of the inferior group are usually given. But no
attempt is made to present a complete picture of
the state of the MSS, for which the student must
go to Madvig.

The best MSS. of de Finibus are: A, Palatinus I,
llth c., which ends soon after the beginning of
Book IV; Β, Palatinus ΙΙ; and E, Erlangensis, 15th c.
These three form one family, within which B and E
are more closely related. The other MSS. known
to Madvig form a second family, inferior in general
to the former, though, as Miiller points out, not to
be entirely dispensed with. Both families according
to Madvig descend from a late and already consider-
ably corrupted archetype.

The earliest edition is believed to have been
printed at Cologne in 1467. Madvig's great com—
mentary (Copenhagen, 1839, 1869, 1876) supersedes
all its predecessors. There is a small annotated
edition, largely based upon Madvig, by W. Μ. L.
Hutchinson (London, 1909).

English translations are those of Samuel Parker
(Tully’s F ire Books de Finibus, οι· Concerning the Last
Objects of Desire and Aversion, done into English by
S. P., Germ, rerisecl . . . by Jeremy Collier, MA„
London, 17⁴022‚· page-heading, Tully of-IlIoral Ends;

Guthrie (London, 1744) 3 of Yonge (in Bolin's series,
1845) ; and of J. S. Reid (Cambridge, 1883, now out
of print). The first of these, and the German version
of Kirchmann in the Philosophische Bibliothek(1868),
Ι have consulted occasionally, the former with plea-
sure, but neither with much profit. 1
