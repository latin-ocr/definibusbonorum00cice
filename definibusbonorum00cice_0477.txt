“ Now inasmuch as our original instinct of desire The perfectiori
was for the possession of the parts aforesaid in their ξέιξιῗξ ἆζξξὲῗοη
fullest natural perfection, it must be allowed that, the Cffief<300d⁷
when we have attained the object of our desire, our
nature takes its stand in this as its final End, and
this constitutes our Chief Good; and that this End
as a whole must be desired intrinsically and in and
for itself, follows of necessity from the fact that the
several parts of it also have already been proved to
be desirable for themselves.

Chief Good which has been propounded.

fact that each part of our nature, both mental and
