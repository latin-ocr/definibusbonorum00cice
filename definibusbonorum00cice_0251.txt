no occasion to argue about pleasure at all ; its criterion
resides in the senses, so that proof is entirely super·
fluous; a reminder of the facts is all that is needed.
Therefore our preceding debate consisted of a simple
statement of the case on either side. There was
nothing abstruse οι· intricate in the discourse of
Torquatus, and my own exposition was, I believe, as
clear as daylight. But the Stoics, as you are aware,
affect an exceedingly subtle or rather crabbed style
of argument; and if the Greeks find it so, still more

and to invent new terms to convey new ideas. This
necessity will cause no surprise to anyone of moderate
learning, when he reflects that in every branch of
science lying outside the range of common everyday
practice there must always be a large degree of
novelty in the vocabulary, when it comes to fixing a
terminology to denote the conceptions with which
