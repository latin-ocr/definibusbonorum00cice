premises. The usual line of reply is to deny the
major premise, and say that not everything good is
praiseworthy; for there is no denying that what is
praiseworthy is morally honourable. But it would
be paradoxical to maintain that there is something
good which is not desirable3 or desirable that is not

just as it is impossible for one who counts death as
an evil not to fear death, so in no case can a man
disregard and despise a thing that he decides to be
evil. This being laid down as generally admitted,

we take as our minor premise that the brave and
