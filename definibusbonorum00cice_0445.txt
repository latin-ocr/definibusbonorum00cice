“Thus we have now set forth six views as to the (Of these six

three are: of pleasure, Aristippus; of freedom from lxofllffeffitfauy
pain, Hieronymus3 of the enjoyment of what we
have called the primary things in accordanee with
nature, Carneades, —that is, he did not originate
this view but he upheld it for purposes of argument.
The three former were possible view,s but only one
of them has been actually m iintained, though that
with great vigour No one has asserted pleasure to
be the sole aim of action in the sense that the mere
intention of attaining pleasum, although unsuccess-
ful, is in itself desirable and moral and the only
good. Nor yet has anyone held that the effort to
avoid pain is in itself a thing desirable, without one’s
being able actually to avoid it. On the otherhand, that (The Stoic view.)

the things in accordance with nature, and vthat this
endeavour even though unsuccessful is itself the sole
thing desirable and the sole good, is actually main-

pleasure, adopted by Callipho and Dinomachus;

with freedom from pain, by Diodorus3 or with the

primary objects of nature, the view of the ancients, as

we entitle both the Academics and the Peripatetics.
