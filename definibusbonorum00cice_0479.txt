spontaneous. To start with the body, do you notice
how nien try to hide a deforined or infirm or maimed
limb? They actually take great pains and trouble
to conceal, if they possibly can, their bodily defect,
or at all events to let it be seen as little as possible3
they even undergo painful courses of treatment in
order to restore the natural appearance of their
limbs, even though the actual use of them will not
only not be improved but will even be dilninished.
In fact, since every man instinctively thinks that he
himself in his entirety is a thing to be desired, and
this not for the sake of anything else but for his own
sake, it follows that when a thing is desired as a
whole for its own sake, the parts also of that thing

. are desired for their own sakes. Again, is there

nothing in the movements and posturcs of the body
which Nature herselfjudges to be ofimportance ? A
man’s mode of walking and sitting, his particular
cast of features and expression —is there nothing in
these things that we consider worthy or unworthy
of a free man? Do we not often think people
deserving of dislike, who by some movement or
posture appear to have violated a law or principle of
nature? And since people try to get rid of these
defects of bearing, why should not even beauty
have a good claim to be considered as desirable
for its own sake? For if we think imperfection or
mutilation of the body things to be avoided for their
own sake, why should we not with equal or perhaps
still greater reason pursue distinction of form for
its own sake? And if we avoid ugliness in bodily
movement and posture, why should we not pursue
beauty? Health also, and strength and freedom
froin pain we shall desire not merely for their utility
