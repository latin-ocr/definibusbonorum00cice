Ἰ 114 the virtues. But if even the body has manyattributes

ofhighervalue than pleasure, such as strength, health,
beauty, speed of foot, what pray think you of the
mind? The wisestphilosophers of old believed that the
mind contains an element of the celestial and divine.
Whereas if the Chief Good consisted in pleasure as
your school avers, the ideal of happiness would be
to pass days and nights in the enjoyment of the
keenest pleasure, without a moment's intermission,
every sense drenched and stimulated with every sort
of delight. But who that is worthy to be called a
human being would choose to pass a single entire
day in pleasure of that description? The Cyrenaics,
it is true, do not repudiate it3 on this point your
friends are more decent, but the Cyrenaics perhaps
more consistent. But let us pass in review not these
‘ arts ' ⁸ of first importance, a lack of which with our
ancestors gave a man the name of ‘ inert ' or good-
for-nothing, but Ι ask you whether you believe that,
I do not say Homer, Archilochus or Pindar, but
Phidias, Polyclitus and Zeuxis regarded the purpose
of their art as pleasure. Then shall a craftsnian
have a higher ideal of externa] than a distinguished
citizen of moral beauty? But what else is the
cause of an error so profound and so very widely
diffused, than the fact that he who decides that
pleasure is the Chief Good judges the question not
with the rational and deliberative part of his mind,
but with its lowest part, the faculty of desire? For
I ask you, if gods exist, as your school too believes,
how can they be happy, seeing that they cannot
enjoy bodily pleasures? or, if they are happy without
that kind of pleasure, why do you deny that the Wise

Man is capable of a like purely mental activity?
