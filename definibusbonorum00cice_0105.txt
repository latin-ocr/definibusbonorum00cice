gether. They therefore say that the first advances
and over-tures, and the original inclination to form an
attachment, are prompted by the desire for pleasure,
but that when the progr-ess of intercourse has led to
intimacy, the relationship blossoms into an affection
strong enough to make us love our friends for their
own sake, even though no practical advantage accrues
from their friendship. Does not familiarity endear to
us localities‚ temples, cities, gymnasia and playing-
grounds, horses and hounds, gladiatorial shows and
fights with wild beasts? Then how much more
natural and reasonable that this should be able to
happen in our intercourse with our fellow-men !—(3)

compact to lov e their friends no less than themselx es.
We can understand the possffirhty ofthis, and w e often
see it happen. Cleaily no more effective means to
happiness could be found than such an alliance.

“ All these considerations go to prove not only that
the theory of friendship is not embarrassed by the
identification of the Chief Good with pleasure, but
also that without this no foundation for friendship
