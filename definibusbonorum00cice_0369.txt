total. This point established, it will then be open
to us to investigate at our leisure your questions
about the importance of the separate items, and the
value of their respective contributions to happiness,
and about that eclipse, as you call it, of the things
so small as to be almost or quite imperceptible.
Then what of a point on which no disagreement Acrenture's
exists? I mean this: no one will dispute that the ξξίξὶξθέζζὲ ‘3⁰³²
supreme and final End, the thing ultimately de-thewholeofit1
sirable‚ is analogous for all natural species alike.
For love of self is inherent in every species; since
what species exists that ever abandons itself or any
part of itself⁷ or any habit or faculty osany such part,
or any of the things, whether processes or states,
that are in accordance with its nature Ρ What species
ever forgot its own original constitution ἒ Assuredly
there is not one that does not retain its own proper

33 faculty srom start to fiuish. llow then came it about

that, ofall the existing species, mankind alone should
relinquish man’s nature, sot-get the body, and find its
Chief Good not in the whole man but in a part of
man? How nioreover is the axiom to be retained,
admitted as it is even by the Stoics and accepted
universally, that the End which is the subjectos our
inquiry is analogous for all species ? For the analogy
to hold, every other species also would have to find its
End in that part of the organism which in that par-
ticular species is the highest part 3 since that, as we
have seen, is how the Stoics conceive the End ofman.
Why then do you hesitate to alter your conception or else the Stoics
of the primary instincts to correspond ? Instead of ⁵h0u¹d.S³y ²¹13*-
