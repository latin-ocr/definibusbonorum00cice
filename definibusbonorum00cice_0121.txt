pleasure in the act of drinking? '' “That is unde-
niable‚” he answered. “ 15 it the same pleasure as
the pleasure, of having quenched one's thirst ? '’
“No, it is a different kind of pleasure, For the
pleasure of having quenched one‘s thirst is a ‘ static ’
pleasure, but the pleasure of actually quenching it is
a ‘kinetic‘ pleasure.” “ Why then,” Ι asked, “ do
you call two such different things by the same
name?” “ Do you not remember,’' he replied,

said I ; “ but though your lang-uage was quite correct
in form, your meaning was far from clear. ‘ Varia-

ducing unlike feelings of pleasure. If this were the
variation you spoke of, I could understand the terni,

‘variation' when you say that when we are free from
pain we experience the highest pleasure, and that
when we are enjoying things that excite a pleasant
activity of the senses, we then experience an active
or ‘ kinetic ’ pleasure that causes a variation of our

pleasure that consists in absence of pain—although
why you should eall this ‘pleasure’ Ι cannot make
out.”
