BOOK IV. ix—x

a triumph to Africanus, use the formula, ‘whereas
by reason of his valour‚' or ‘good fortune,' if no
one but the Wise Man can truly be said to possess
either valour or good fortune? What sort of a
philosophy then is this, which speaks the ordinary
language in public, but in its treatises employs an
idiom of its own? and that though the doctrines
which the Stoics express in their own peculiar
ternis contain no actual novelty; the ideas remain
the same, though clothed in another dress. Why,
what difference does it make whether you call
wealth, power, health ‘goods‚' or ζ things pre-
ferred,’ when he who calls them goods assigns no
more value to them than you who style exactly the
same things ‘preferred'? This is why so eminent
and high-minded an authority as Panaetius, a worthy
member of the famous circle of Scipio and Laelius,
in his epistle to Quintus Tubero on the endurance
of pain, has nowhere made what ought to have been
his most effective point, if it could be shown to be
true, namely that pain is not an evil; instead he
defines its nature and properties, estimates the de-
gree of its divergence from nature, and lastly pre—
scribes the method by which it is to be endured.
So that by his vote, seeing that he was a Stoic, your
terminological fatuities seem to me to stand con-
demned.
