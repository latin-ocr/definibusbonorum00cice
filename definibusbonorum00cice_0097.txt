BOOK Ι. xviii-xix

to the follies of love, impudent or reckless, wauton,
headstrong and yet irresolute‚ always changing their
minds. Such failings render their lives one unbroken
round of misery. The conclusion is that no foolish
man can be happy, nor any wise man fail to be
happy. This is a truth that we establish far more
conclusively than do the Stoics. For they maintain
that nothing is good save that vague phantom which
they entitle Moral Worth, a title more splendid than
substantial; and say that Virtue resting on this
Moral Worth has no need of pleasure‚ but is herself
her own sufficient happiness.

stated in a form which we do not object to, and in- always kapp*
deed ourselves endorse. For Epicurus thus presents
his Wise Man who is always happy: his desires are
kept within bounds; death he disregards3 he has a
true conception, untainted by sear, of the Divine
nature ; he does not hesitate to depart from life, if
that would better his condition. Thus equipped he
enjoys perpetual pleasure, for there is no moment
when the pleasures he experiences do not outbalance
the pains3 since he remembers the past with grati-
tude, grasps the present with a full realization of its
pleasantness, and does not rely upon the future;
he looks forward to it, but finds his true enjoyment
in the present. Also he is entirely free from the
vices that I instanced a few moments ago, and he
derives no inconsiderable pleasure from comparing
his own existence with the life of the foolish. More-
over, any pains that the &Vise Man may encounter are
never so severe but that he has more cause for glad-

63 ness than for sorrow. Again‚ it is a fine saying of ξέοῗὲὲᾞξ, {2
Epicurus that ‘the Wise Man is but little interfered tune.
