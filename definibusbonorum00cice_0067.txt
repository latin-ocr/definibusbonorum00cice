that are obvious and exident.) Strip mankind of
sensation‚ and nothing remains; it follows that
Nature herselfis the judge of that which is in accord-
ance with or contrary to nature. What does Nature
perceive or what does she judge of, beside pleasure
and pain, to guide her actions of desire and oi
avoidance? Some members of our school however
would refine upon this doctrine3 these say that it is
not enough for the judgment of good and evil to
rest with the se11ses3 the facts that plcasure is in
and for itself desirable and pain in and for itself
to be avoided can also be grasped by the intellect
and the reason. Accordingly they declare that
the perception that the one is to be sought after and
the other avoided is a notion naturally implanted in
our minds. Others again, with whom Ι agree, ob-
serving that a great many philosophers do advance a
vast array of reasons to prove wli)v pleasure should
not be counted as a good nor pain as an evil, consider
that we had better not be too confident of our case:
in their view it requires elaborate and reasoned
argument, and abstruse theoretical discussion of the
nature of pleasure and pain. ⁵
