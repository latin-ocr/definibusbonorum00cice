BOOK II. xxii-xxiii

take me for such an imbecile,' you exclaim, ‘as to talk
in that sashion before ignorant people?'——Well‚ make
the same profession in a law-court, or if you are afraid

of the public there, say it in the senate. You will
never do it. Why, if not because such language is

disgraceful ? Then what a compliment to Torquatus
and myself, to use it in our presence !

XXIII. “But let us grantyour position. The actual
word ‘ pleasure ’ has not a losty sound ; and per-
haps we do not understand its significance : you are
always repeating that we do not understand what
you mean by pleasure. As though it were a diffie—ult
or recondite notion ! If we understand you when you
talk of ‘ indivisible atoms' and ‘ cosmic interspaces‚’
things that don't exist and never can exist, is
our intelligence incapable of grasping the meaning

of pleasure, a feeling known to every sparrow? What
if I force you to admit that Ι do know not only what
pleasure really is (it is an agreeable activity of the
sense), but also what you mean by it? For at one
moment you mean by it the feeling that I have just
defined, and this you entitle ‘kinetic' pleasure, as
producing a definite change of feeling, but at another
moment you say it is quite a different feeling, which
is the acme and climax of pleasure, but yet consists
merely in the complete absence of pain3 this you
call ‘ static ’ pleasure. Well, grant that pleasure is
the latter sort of feeling. Profess in any public
assembly that the motive of all your actions is the
desire to avoid pain. If you feel that this too does
not sound sufficiently dignified and respectable, say
that you intend both in your present office and all
your life long to act solely for the sake of your own
advantage,-to do nothing but what will pay, nothing
