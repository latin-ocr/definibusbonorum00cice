INTRODUCTION

The fullest treatment in English of the subjects Blooles of
dealt with in de Finibus will be found in Zeller's liffereme.
Stoics, Epicuream and Sceptics and Eclectics. Zeller's
monumental work requires supplementing especially
in regard to Stoicism. Recent books of value are
Arnold's Roman Stoicis-m, Hicks's Sloic and Epicurean,
and Bevan's Stoics ancl Scepsius: Reid's edition of
Academica is a mine of information about Cic-ero's
philosophical work. For the sources, a selection for
beginners is Adain's Ταῖάν to Illas-[rate Greek Philosophy
qflel· A rislolle.

Ι must express my gratitude to my friend Miss
W. M. L. Hutchinson for reading· the proofs of my
translation and doing much to improve it. Nor can
Ι forget my debt to the late Dr. dames Adam, whose
lectures on de Finibus first aroused my interest in
ethical theory.

In revising this work for re-issue I had the advan-
tage of consulting the late Professor J. S. Reid's
learned connnentary on Books Ι and 11, published
1925. For Books III-IV, 43, Ι derived valuable aid
from his MS. notes, kindly lent me by Mrs. Reid, and
for the rest from his published translation ; of course
neither can be assumed to represent his final views.
The loss of a complete edition froin so great a Cicero-
nian and student of the post-Aristotelian schools is
much to be deplored. The Latin text is unaltered
save for a few trifling corrections.

Books IV, V, on R (Rottendorfianus, 12th c., closely
related to Α, and collated by Schiche for his Teubner
edition, 1915). Both Martha and Schiche place only
limited confidence in Β and E.
