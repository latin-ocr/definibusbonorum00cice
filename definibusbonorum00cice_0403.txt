BOOK IV. xxiii-xxiv

Roman ancestors) believing that a man who lived
morally, if he also had health, wealth and reputation,
had a preferable, better, more desirable life than he
who, though equally good, was, like Alcmaeon in
Ennius,
Beset on every side
With sickness, banishment and poverty.

63 Those men of old then, with their duller wits, think

that the formerlife is more desirable, more excellent,
more happy; the Stoics on the other hand consider
it merely to be preferred for choice, not because it
is a happier life but because it is more adapted to
nature. The Stoics we must suppose discerned a
truth that had escaped their predecessors, namely
that men defiled by crimes aud murdcrs are no
more miserable than those who though pious and
upright in their lives have not yet attained ideal and

Stoics are so fond of employing. Of course every-

in deep water and trying to get out, those already
approaching the surface, though nearer to breathing,
will be no more able actually to breathe than those
at the bottom. You infer that improvement and
progress in virtue are of no avail to save a man from
being utterly wretched, until he has actually arrived
at virtue, since to rise in the water is of no avail.
Again, since puppies on the point of opening their
eyes are as blind as those only just born, it follows
that Plato, not having yet attained to the vision of
wisdom, was just as blind mentally as Phalaris!
