of the past. We have the power both to obliterate
our inisfortunes in an almost perpetual forgetfulness
and to summon up pleasant and agreeable memor-ies

you denounce as a voluptuary, cries aloud that no
one can live pleasantly without living wisely‚ honour-
ably and justly, and no one wisely‚ honourably and
