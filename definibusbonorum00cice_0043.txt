BOOK I. iii

the Greeks as a philosopher. Still, you yourself
challenged me to the venture, by dedicating to me
your delightful essay On V irlne. But Ι have no
doubt that the reason why some people take a
dislike to Latin literature is that they have happened
to meet with certain illiterate and uncouth produc·
tions which are bad Greek books in worse Latin
versions. I have no quai-rel with these persons,
provided that they also refuse to read the Greek
writers on the same subjects. But given a noble
theme, and a refined, dignified and graceful style,
who would not read a Latin book? Unless it be some
one ambitious to be styled a Greek out—and-out, as
9 Albucius was greeted by Scaevola when the latter

was praetor at Athens. I ain again referring to
Lucilius, who relates the auec-dote with much neat-
ness and point3 he puts the following excellent lines
into the mouth of Scaevola:

“ You vow'd, Albucius, that to suit ye

'Twas as a Greek we must repnte ye;

‘Roman’ and ‘Sabine' being names

Your man of ton and taste disclaims!

You scorn’d to own your native town,—

Which bore such captains of renown

As Pontius and Tritannus bold,

who in the van Rome's ensigns hold.

And so, at Athens when I lay,

And your respects you came to pay,

My worship, humouring your freak,

Gave you good-morrow straight in Greek,

with ‘ chaire, Titus !’ ‘ Chaire: bawi

Guards, aides-de-camp, javelin-men and all ἕ

—Hence comes it that Albucius hates me,

Hence as his bitterest foe he rates me.'’
