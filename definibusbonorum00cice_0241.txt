the heroes praised by Homer, not of Cyrus or Agesi-

Then are we to say that a youth is a young inan of

pleasure usurps the sovereignty‚ all the cardinal
virtues must inevitably be dethroned3 and also
there are a number of base qualities which can
with difficulty be proved inconsistent with the
character of the Wise Man, unless it be a law of

Virtue must needs keep Pleasure at arin’s length.
