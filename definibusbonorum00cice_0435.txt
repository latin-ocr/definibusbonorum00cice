this too was treated by the Peripatetics‚ so as to com-
prise not only the principles of individual conduct
but also of the government of states. From Aristotle
we learn the manners, customs and institutions, and
from Theophrastus the laws also, of nearly all the
states not only of Greece but of the barbarians as
well. Both described the proper qualifications of a
stutesman, both moreover wrote lengthy treatises on
the best form of constitution; Theophrastus treated
the subject inore fully, disc-ussing the forces and
occasions of political change, and their control as
circumstances demand. Among the alternative ideals
of condu'ct they gave the highest place to the life of
retirement, devoted to contemplation and to study.
This was pronounced to be most worthy of the Wise
Man, as most nearly resembling the life of the gods.
And these topics they handle in a style as brilliant
as it is illuminating.

V. “Their books on the subject of the Chief Divergences

Good fall into two classes, one popular in style, and
this class they used to call their avolet-ic works; the
other more caresully wrought.a The latter treatises
they left in the form ofnote-books. This distinction oc-
casionally gives them an appearance of inconsistency 3
but as a matter of fact in the main body of their
doctrine there is no divergence‚ at all events among
the philosophers Ι have mentioned‚nor did they dis-
agree among themselves. But on the chief object
of inquiry, namely Happiness, and the one question
which philosophy has to consider and to investigate,
whether this lies entirely within the control of the
Wise Man, or whether it can be impaired or destroyed
by adversity‚ here there does appear sometimes to
exist among them some divergence and uncertainty.
This effect is chiefly produced by Theophrastus's
