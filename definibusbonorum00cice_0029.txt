INTRODUCTION

templation; and that though for this a modicum of
external goods is needed, these are but indispensable
conditions‚ and in no way constituent parts, of the
Chief Good.

The fact is that philosophy in Cicero's day had
lost all precision as well as originality. It must be
admitted that de Finibus declines in interest when it
comes to deal with contemporary thought. Not only
does the plan of the work necessitate some repetition
in Book V ofarguments already rehearsed in Book 1V;
but Antiochus's perversion of preceding systems
impairs alike the criticism of the Stoics and the
presentation of his own ethic-al doctrine.

The text of this edition is founded on that of The Text.
Madvig, whose representatives have kindly per-
mitted use to be made of the latest edition of his
de Finibus, dated 1876. Madvig first established
the text of the book; and it is from no lack of
appreciation for his Herculean labours that Ι have
ventured here and there to modify his results,
whether by adopting conjectures suggested in his
notes, or by presel-ring MSS. readings rejected by
him, or conjectures made by other scholars and in
one or two places by myself. In supplementing
Madvig’s work I have derived much help froin the
Teubner text of C. W. F. Muller, 1904.1 Madxvig‘s
punctuation I have altered throughout, both to con-
form it with English usage and also occasionally to
suggest a different connection of thought.

Departures from Madvig’s text (referred to as The critical
Mdv.) are noted at the foot of the page. So also Noles.
are MSS. variants of importance sor the sense;
in such places the readings of the three best MSS.

² A new Teubner text by Schiche appeared in 1915.
