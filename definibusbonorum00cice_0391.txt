or may not want to laugh, but he will not go away any

stronger to endure pain than he came. You how-

ever say that no one can be brave who thinks pain

an evil. Why should he be braver for thinking it

what you yourself admit it to be, irksome and

not Β. Thus, if your conclusions are upset‚ your
