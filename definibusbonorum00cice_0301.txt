BOOK 111. xv

Diogenes, though so important for pleasure and
health as to be not merely conducive but actually
essential to them, yet has not the same effect in rela-
tion to virtue, nor yet in the case of the other arts3 for
money may be a guide to these, but cannot form an
6556111131 factor in them3 therefore although if plea-
sure 01 if good health be a good, wealth also must be
count-ed a good, yet if wisdom is a good, it does not
follow that we must also 111-0110111166 wealth to be a
good. Nor can anything which is not a good be essen-
1131 10 3 thing that is a good3 and hence, because
acts of cognition and of comprehension, which form
the raw material of the arts, excite desire, since
wealth is not a good, wealth cannot be essential to
any art. But even is we allowed wealth to be
essential to the 3115, 1116 531116 argument neverthe-
less could not be applied to virtue, because virtue (as
Diogenes argues) requires a great amount of thought
and practice, which is not the case to the same extent
with the 3115Ῐι 311(1 because virtue involves life-long
steadfastness, strength and consistency‚ whereas these
qualities are not equally manifested in the 3115.
